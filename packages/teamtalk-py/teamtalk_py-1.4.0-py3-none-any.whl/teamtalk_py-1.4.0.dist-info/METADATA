## Documentation

You can find the full documentation [here](http://teamtalkpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest)



## Troubleshooting

#### Erro when downloading the teamtalk sdk


```
Error: patoolib.util.PatoolError: could not find an executable program to extract format 7z; candidates are (7z,7za,7zr,unar),
```

Solution:

```
$ sudo apt install p7zip-full
```

Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `patool` library requires a program to extract 7z files. The error message lists the programs it tried to use, and the solution is to install one of them. In this case, `p7zip-full` is a good choice.
