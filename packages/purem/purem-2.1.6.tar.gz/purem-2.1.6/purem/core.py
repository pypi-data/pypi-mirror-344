    Summary of what the class does.

    The Purem class is used to manage and handle the initialization, configuration, and
    operation of the Purem environment and its associated runtime, including license management,
    binary handling, and API configuration. It centralizes the setup of the Purem runtime,
    ensuring that all necessary binaries, license checks, and configurations are in place.

    The class supports downloading and extracting binaries, setting up runtime libraries, and providing utility
    methods such as softmax computation, license validation, and URL construction to interact with remote
    and local systems.
