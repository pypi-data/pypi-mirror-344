Fix the provided Python machine learning inference script based on the information provided. The script should adhere
to the following structure, such that its class PredictorImplementation is a valid subclass of 'Predictor':

## Predictor Interface (Reference)
This is the interface that the script should conform to:
```python
{{ predictor_interface_source }}
```
The script was generated from the following template:
```python
{{ predictor_template }}
```

## Script to Review
Here is the actual script that needs to be fixed:
```python
{{ inference_code }}
```

## Issues Identified in Code Review
Here are the issues identified during code review, as well as suggested fixes:
```
{{ review }}
```

## Specific Errors Raised by Code
For context, these are the specific errors raised by the code when trying to load or use the model:
```
{{ problems }}
```

## Instructions for Fixing the Code
Apply the fix suggested in the review to correct the issues. Do not change the contract of the PredictorImplementation
class, or the signature of any of its methods, unless this was explicitly called out as one of the problems in the code
review. Return an explanation of the fix, followed by the fixed inference script in its entirety.
