Review the Python machine learning inference script below to spot any issues. The script should adhere to the
following structure, such that its class PredictorImplementation is a valid subclass of 'Predictor':

## Predictor Interface (Reference)
This is the interface that the script should conform to:
```python
{{ predictor_interface_source }}
```
The script was generated from the following template:
```python
{{ predictor_template }}
```

## Script to Review
Here is the actual script that needs to be reviewed:
```python
{{ inference_code }}
```

## Context About the Model
The input schema for the 'inputs' parameter is as follows:
```python
{{ input_schema }}
```
The output schema for the return value is as follows:
```python
{{output_schema}}
```
The model itself was generated by the following training code:
```python
{{training_code}}
```
When doing a static analysis of the code, the following issues were spotted. IMPORTANT: The error in
'SPECIFIC ERRORS' indicateS what went wrong when trying to load or use the model.
```
{{problems}}
```

## Review Instructions
Suggest a single, actionable improvement for fixing the issues. Give a concise but complete statement of the
fix that should be applied to this script to make it work.
