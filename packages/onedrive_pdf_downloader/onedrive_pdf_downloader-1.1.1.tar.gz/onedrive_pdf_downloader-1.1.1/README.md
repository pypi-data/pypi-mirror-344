# üìÑ PDF Exporter from Authenticated OneDrive Sessions

This project allows you to export PDFs, even those that are protected, from authenticated OneDrive sessions using Selenium. The tool automates the browser process to capture screenshots of each page and combine them into a PDF file. Works also on OneDrive for Business.

> [!WARNING]
> This tool may need to be calibrated in order to work correctly. It is expected to be used by someone who can inspect a page and read HTML.

## üìã Requirements

Before running the project, you need the following dependencies:

### üåê Browsers:
Make sure that you have one of the following browsers installed:
- Firefox
- Chrome

### üîß Browser Drivers:
To interact with your browser via Selenium, you need the appropriate driver for your browser:
- **Geckodriver** for Firefox: [Download Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest)
- **Chromedriver** for Chrome: [Download Chromedriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable)

Ensure the drivers are in your system‚Äôs `PATH` or specify their location explicitly when launching the browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1. Install via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install onedrive_pdf_downloader
    ```

2. Download and install the appropriate browser drivers for your browser.

3. Optionally, set up a browser profile to retain session information:
    - **Firefox:**
        - Create a Firefox profile through `about:profiles` in the browser's address bar.
        - Use the `-p` option to specify the path to the Firefox profile directory.
    - **Chrome:**
        - Specify the Chrome user data directory and profile name using `-p` and `-n` options. You can find this in `chrome://version/`.

## üöÄ Usage

To run the script, use the following command structure:

```bash
onedrive-pdf-downloader [options]
```

### ‚ö° Command-line Options

| Argument             | Description                                                                              | Example                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `--browser, -b`      | Specify the browser to use (`firefox` or `chrome`).                                      | `--browser firefox`                 |
| `--profile-dir, -p`  | Path to the browser profile directory. If using Chrome, specify the user data directory. | `--profile-dir /path/to/profile`    |
| `--profile-name, -n` | Profile name to use (Chrome only).                                                       | `--profile-name "Profile 1"`        |
| `--keep-imgs, -k`    | Keep the temporary images used for PDF creation.                                         | `--keep-imgs`                       |
| `--output-file, -o`  | Specify the output file name.                                                            | `--output-file file.pdf`            |

### üóëÔ∏è Uninstall

To uninstall the package, you can use pip:
```bash
pip uninstall onedrive_pdf_downloader
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Profile Setup:
To use an authenticated session, you may need to use a browser profile where you're already logged in. Here‚Äôs how to do that:

- **Firefox Profile:**
    1. Open Firefox and type `about:profiles` in the address bar.
    2. Create a new profile or use an existing one. The profile path will be displayed under "Root Directory."
    3. Use the `--profile-dir` option to point to this directory in the script.

- **Chrome Profile:**
    1. Open Chrome and type `chrome://version` in the address bar.
    2. Find the `Profile Path`
    3. Use the `--profile-dir` option for the user data directory (e.g., `/path/to/profiles`) and the `--profile-name` option for the profile name (e.g., `Default`).

### üìÇ Getting the Cache Path:
To use the `--cache-dir` option, you need to find the cache directory of your browser. Here‚Äôs how to do that:

- **Firefox:**
    1. Open Firefox and type `about:profiles` in the address bar.
    2. Locate the profile you are using and find the "Local Directory" path.
    3. The cache directory is typically located within this path under `cache2/entries`.
    
    Basically, `{profile_path}/cache2/entries`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Calibrating the Tool

If the tool is not working correctly, you may need to update the class names and ARIA labels used to identify elements on the OneDrive page. These values are defined in the [browser/constants.py](src/onedrive_pdf_downloader/browser/constants.py#L6) file.

### üìù Steps to Calibrate:

1. **Open the OneDrive page in your browser:**
   - Use the browser's inspector tool (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I in most browsers, or right-click and select "Inspect") to find the class names or the ARIA labels for the elements used by the script.

2. **Update the class names and ARIA labels in the script:**
   - Open the [browser/constants.py](src/onedrive_pdf_downloader/browser/constants.py#L6) file.
   - Update the following lists with the new values:
     ```python
     CLASS_NAMES_TOTAL_PAGES = ["status_5a88b9b2"]  # Add the new class names for the total pages element
     CLASS_NAMES_FILE_NAME = ["OneUpNonInteractiveCommandNewDesign_156f96ef"]  # Add the new class names for the file name element
     CLASS_NAMES_TOOLBAR = ["root_5a88b9b2"]  # Add the new class names for the toolbar element
     ARIA_LABELS_NEXT_PAGE = ["Vai alla pagina successiva."]  # Add the new ARIA labels for the next page button
     ```

3. **Save the changes and run the script again:**
   - Save the updated [browser/constants.py](src/onedrive_pdf_downloader/browser/constants.py#L6) file.
   - Run the script with the updated values to ensure it works correctly.

By following these steps, you can calibrate the tool to work with any changes in the OneDrive page structure.
