"""
Field definitions for screw operation data.

This module contains dataclasses that define the field names used in:
1. JSON files containing measurement data
2. CSV file containing metadata and classification information

These constants provide a centralized reference for accessing data consistently
throughout the codebase.

@dataclass
class JsonFields:
    """
    Constants for field names in the JSON files containing screw operation data.
    These classes define the naming conventions used in the raw JSON data files
    from the screw driving control.

    Note: The string values (e.g. "id code", "time values") are pre-defined by
    the screw driving control and cannot be changed. Our constant names use a
    more consistent style and align with the CSV field naming (e.g., mapping JSON's
    "result" to WORKPIECE_RESULT to match the CSV's "workpiece_result" field).
