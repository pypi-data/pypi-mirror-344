# GraphFaker

GraphFaker is a Python library and CLI tool for generating, loading, and exporting synthetic and real-world graph datasets. It supports `faker`  as social graph, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, and real airline flight networks. Use it for data science, research, teaching, rapid prototyping, and more!

*Note: The authors and graphgeeks labs do not hold any responsibility for the correctness of this generator.*

## Features
- **Multiple Graph Sources:**
  - `faker`: Synthetic social graphs with rich node/edge types
  - `osm`: Real-world road networks from OpenStreetMap
  - `flights`: Real airline, airport, and flight networks
- **Flexible Export:** GraphML, JSON, CSV, RDF, and more
- **Easy CLI & Python API**

## Installation

Install from PyPI:
```sh
uv pip install graphfaker
```

For development:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/denironyx/graphfaker.git
cd graphfaker
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

Show help:
```sh
python -m graphfaker.cli --help
```

#### Generate a Synthetic Social Graph
```sh
python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
    --source faker \
    --total-nodes 100 \
    --total-edges 500
```

#### Generate a Real-World Road Network (OSM)
```sh
python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
    --source osm \
    --place "Berlin, Germany" \
    --network-type drive \
    --export berlin.graphml
```

#### Generate a Flight Network (Airlines/Airports/Flights)
```sh
python -m graphfaker.cli gen \
    --source flights \
    --country "United States" \
    --year 2024 \
    --month 1 \
    --export flights.graphml
```

You can also use `--date-range` for custom time spans (e.g., `--date-range "2024-01-01,2024-01-15"`).

### Python API Usage

```python
from graphfaker import GraphFaker

gf = GraphFaker()
# Synthetic social/knowledge graph
g1 = gf.generate_graph(source="faker", total_nodes=200, total_edges=800)
# OSM road network
g2 = gf.generate_graph(source="osm", place="Berlin, Germany", network_type="drive")
# Flight network
g3 = gf.generate_graph(source="flights", country="United States", year=2024, month=1)

```

#### Advanced: Date Range for Flights

Note this isn't recommended and it's still being tested. We are working on ways to make this faster.
```python
g = gf.generate_graph(source="flights", country="United States", date_range=("2024-01-01", "2024-01-15"))
```

## Future Plans: Graph Export Formats

- **GraphML**: General graph analysis/visualization (`--export graph.graphml`) ✔️
- **JSON/JSON-LD**: Knowledge graphs/web apps (`--export data.json`)
- **CSV**: Tabular analysis/database imports (`--export edges.csv`)
- **RDF**: Semantic web/linked data (`--export graph.ttl`)

---

## Future Plans: Integration with Graph Tools

GraphFaker generates NetworkX graph objects that can be easily integrated with:
- **Graph databases**: Neo4j, Kuzu, TigerGraph
- **Analysis tools**: NetworkX, SNAP, graph-tool
- **ML frameworks**: PyTorch Geometric, DGL, TensorFlow GNN
- **Visualization**: Gephi, Cytoscape, D3.js
