## How to Suggest a New Feature

At **DKBOTZDB**, weâ€™re always eager to improve and enhance the database solution by adding new features that make it even more powerful and user-friendly. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'd love to hear from you! ðŸš€

2. **Create a New Issue**:
   - If your feature hasnâ€™t been suggested already, you can submit a **new issue**. To do this, go to our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/DKBOTZPROJECT/DKBOTZDB/issues), click on the **"New Issue"** button, and select **"Feature Request"**.
   - Provide a **clear and detailed description** of the feature you'd like to suggest.
   - Mention the **use cases** where this feature would be helpful and how it can improve the user experience.

3. **Be Specific and Provide Examples**:
   - The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and consider your suggestion.
   - You can include code snippets, user stories, or any relevant links that will help us understand your request.

### Example of a Good Feature Request:
   - **Title**: "Add ability to update multiple records at once"
   - **Description**: "Currently, the `update_one()` function is available, but it would be really helpful if we could update multiple records at once. This could be beneficial for bulk operations like updating multiple users' status at the same time."
   - **Use Case**: "I have a situation where I need to update the status of multiple records based on certain criteria. It would save time and resources to do this in a single API call."
