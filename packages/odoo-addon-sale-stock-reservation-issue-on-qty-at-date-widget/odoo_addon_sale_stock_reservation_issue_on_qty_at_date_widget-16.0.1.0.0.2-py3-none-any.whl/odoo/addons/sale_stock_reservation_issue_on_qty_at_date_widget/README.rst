color of the widget icon to yellow (warning color) when you are going to

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because Qty At Date Widget doesn't warn when
you are going to sell more quantity than you have in stock with all
planned operations included (free quantity today).

It will be useful for you if you want to avoid unreservations to fulfill
another orders that were planned earlier.

Installation
============

In order to use this module, you need to install the next module:

- sale_management

Usage
=====

Example of use:

1. Create an Storable product and update available quantity for 20
   units.
2. Create a new Sale and select the product you've created previously.
3. Sell an order for tomorrow for 10 units. Ensure picking is reserved.
4. Create an order for tomorrow for 20 units.
5. Check the Qty At Date icon is in yellow (warning color) because you
   are going to sell 10 units that are reserved for another order.
