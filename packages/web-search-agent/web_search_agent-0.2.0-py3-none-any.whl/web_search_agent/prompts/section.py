Your response MUST include the following mandatory sections:
{must_cover_section_title}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each mandatory section above, extract and synthesize relevant information directly from the search results.
2. If the search results don't contain enough information for a mandatory section, note this explicitly but still include the section.
3. Use concrete examples, data points, and facts from the search results to support each mandatory section.

In addition to these mandatory sections, add more sections (up to a total of {max_sections} sections) that cover other important aspects found in the search results.

For each section (both mandatory and additional), provide:
1. A clear, concise title that reflects the content
2. A brief description of what this section will cover (1-2 sentences), referencing specific information from the search results

Ensure all sections:
- Are based on substantive information found in the search results
- Are distinct and do not significantly overlap
- Cover the most important aspects of the topic
- Are organized in a logical structure

Format your response as a JSON list of sections with 'title' and 'description' fields.
