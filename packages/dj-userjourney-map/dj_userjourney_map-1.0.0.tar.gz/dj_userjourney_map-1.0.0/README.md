# Quick Start

This section provides a fast and easy guide to getting the `dj-userjourney-map` package up and running in your Django project.
Follow the steps below to quickly set up the package and start using the package.

## 1. Install the Package

**Option 1: Using `pip` (Recommended)**

Install the package via pip:

```bash
$ pip install dj-userjourney-map
```
**Option 2: Using `Poetry`**

If you're using Poetry, add the package with:

```bash
$ poetry add dj-userjourney-map
```

**Option 3: Using `pipenv`**

If you're using pipenv, install the package with:

```bash
$ pipenv install dj-userjourney-map
```

## 2. Install Django REST Framework (Optional for API Support)

If you plan to use the optional DRF API for managing user journey maps, you will need to install Django REST Framework. If it's not already installed in your project, you can install it:

**Using pip:**

```bash
$ pip install djangorestframework
```

## 3. Add to Installed Apps

After installing the necessary packages, ensure that both `rest_framework` (if using the API) and `persona_manager` are added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django `settings.py` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   # ...
   "rest_framework",  # Only needed if using the API

   "persona_manager",
   "journey_map",
   # ...
]
```

### 4. (Optional) Configure API Filters

To enable filtering through the API, install ``django-filter``, include ``django_filters`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and configure the filter settings.

Install ``django-filter``:

**Using pip:**

```bash
$ pip install django-filter
```

Add `django_filters` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   # ...
   "django_filters",
   # ...
]
```

Then, set the filter class configuration in your ``settings.py``:

```python
JOURNEY_MAP_API_USER_JOURNEY_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.UserJourneyFilter"
JOURNEY_MAP_API_JOURNEY_STAGE_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.JourneyStageFilter"
JOURNEY_MAP_API_JOURNEY_ACTION_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.JourneyActionFilter"
JOURNEY_MAP_API_USER_FEEDBACK_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.UserFeedbackFilter"
JOURNEY_MAP_API_PAIN_POINT_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.PainPointFilter"
JOURNEY_MAP_API_OPPORTUNITY_FILTERSET_CLASS = "journey_map.api.filters.OpportunityFilter"
```

You can also define your custom `FilterClass` and reference it in here if needed. This allows you to customize the filtering behavior according to your requirements. for more detailed info, refer to the [Settings](#settings) section.


## 5. Apply Migrations

Run the following command to apply the necessary migrations:
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

## 6. Add project URLs

If you wish to use the optional API or the Django Template View Include them in your project’s `urls.py` file:
```python
from django.urls import path, include
from persona_manager.views import UserPersonaListView

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    # User Persona related urls
    path("user_persona/", UserPersonaListView.as_view(), name="user-persona-list"), # Template View
    path("user_persona/api/", include("persona_manager.api.routers.main")),   # Only needed if using the API

    # User Journey Map related urls
    path('journey_map/', include("journey_map.urls")), # List & Detail Template View
    path('journey_map/api/', include("journey_map.api.routers")) # Only needed if using the API
    # ...
]
```

```ini
USER_JOURNEY_API_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "100/day"
USER_JOURNEY_API_STAFF_THROTTLE_RATE = "60/minute"
```

Custom throttle classes can be defined for each ViewSet and referenced in the settings.

---

## Ordering, Filtering, and Search

The API supports ordering, filtering, and searching across all endpoints:

- **Ordering**: Results can be ordered by fields specific to each ViewSet (e.g., `order`, `created_at`).
- **Filtering**: Requires `django-filter` to be installed. Add `django_filters` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and specify filter classes (e.g., `journey_map.api.filters.UserJourneyFilter`) in settings.
- **Search**: Searchable fields are configurable via `search_fields` in each ViewSet.

These features can be customized in the Django settings.

---

## Pagination

The API uses limit-offset pagination, with configurable minimum, maximum, and default page sizes to control the number of results per page.

---

## Permissions

The default permission is `IsAuthenticated`, allowing access to all users. You can customize permissions by adding classes like `IsAdminUser` or creating custom permission classes in the settings.

---

## Parser Classes

The API supports the following default parsers:

- `JSONParser`
- `MultiPartParser`
- `FormParser`

You can modify parser classes for each ViewSet by updating the API settings to include additional parsers or customize existing ones.

---

## Configuration

All features (throttling, permissions, parsers, etc.) can be configured through the Django settings file. Refer to the [Settings](#settings) section for details.

# Usage

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the package's key features, including the functionality of
the Django admin panels for managing user behaviors.

## Admin Site

If you are using a **custom admin site** in your project, you must pass your custom admin site configuration in your
Django settings. Otherwise, Django may raise the following error during checks or the ModelAdmin will not accessible in
the Admin panel.

To resolve this, In your ``settings.py``, add the following setting to specify the path to your custom admin site class
instance

```python
JOURNEY_MAP_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.your.custom.site"
```

example of a custom Admin Site:

```python
from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite


class CustomAdminSite(AdminSite):
    site_header = "Custom Admin"
    site_title = "Custom Admin Portal"
    index_title = "Welcome to the Custom Admin Portal"


# Instantiate the custom admin site as example
example_admin_site = CustomAdminSite(name="custom_admin")
```

and then reference the instance like this:

```python
JOURNEY_MAP_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.example_admin_site"
```

This setup allows `dj-userjourney-map` to use your custom admin site for its Admin interface, preventing any errors and
ensuring a smooth integration with the custom admin interface.

# User Journey Map Admin

The `dj-userjourney-package` provides a robust Django admin interface for managing user journey maps, including `UserJourney`, `JourneyStage`, `JourneyAction`, `UserFeedback`, `PainPoint`, and `Opportunity` models.

Thank you for providing the details about the permission classes for the `dj-userjourney-package`. I’ve noted the following key points:

- **Permission Class Structure**: The package supports Django REST Framework (DRF)-style permission classes that must implement a `has_permission(self, request, view)` method, returning a boolean to indicate whether access is granted. For example, a typical implementation checks for user authentication, as shown in your example.
- **Pre-defined Permission Classes**: When DRF is not used, the package provides built-in permission classes located at:
  - `journey_map.permissions.IsAuthenticated`
  - `journey_map.permissions.IsAdminUser`
  - `journey_map.permissions.IsSuperUser`
  - `journey_map.permissions.AllowAny`
  - `journey_map.permissions.BasePermission` (a base class for implementing custom permissions).
- **DRF Compatibility**: DRF permission classes can also be used if DRF is part of the project.
- **Default Permission**: The default permission class is set to `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS = "journey_map.permissions.IsAuthenticated"`, requiring users to be authenticated to access the views.

Since you’ve already provided the template views and an example section, and I’ve prepared the template views section, I assume you’d like me to update or confirm the template views section to reflect these permission details explicitly. Below, I’ve revised the **Template Views** section to incorporate the permission class details, ensuring accuracy and alignment with the provided information. If you meant for me to prepare a different section or have additional requirements, please clarify!

# User Journey Template Views

The `dj-userjourney-map` provides two class-based template views, `JourneyMapListView` and `JourneyMapDetailView`, for rendering user journey maps in a web interface. These views leverage Django’s generic views (`ListView` and `DetailView`) and include robust permission checks to control access, supporting both Django REST Framework (DRF)-style and package-specific permission classes. Below is a detailed overview of each view’s functionality and features.

---

## JourneyMapListView

The `JourneyMapListView` is a class-based `ListView` that displays a list of all user journeys, allowing users to browse and select a journey to view its detailed map.

### Features

#### Template
- **Template Name**: `journey_map_list.html`
- **Context Object Name**: `journeys`
- **Description**: Renders a list of `UserJourney` instances, typically displayed as a clickable list or table for navigation to detailed views.

#### Queryset
- **Model**: `UserJourney`
- **Optimization**: Uses `select_related("persona")` to fetch the associated `UserPersona` in a single query, reducing database hits.
- **Ordering**: Journeys are ordered by `name` for consistent presentation.

#### Access Control
- **Permission Classes**: Defined by `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS`, defaulting to `journey_map.permissions.IsAuthenticated`. This requires users to be authenticated (i.e., `request.user.is_authenticated` returns `True`).
- **Supported Permissions**:
  - Package-specific: `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `IsSuperUser`, `AllowAny` (from `journey_map.permissions`).
  - DRF-style: Any permission class with a `has_permission(self, request, view)` method, such as DRF’s `rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated`.
  - Custom: Inherit from `journey_map.permissions.BasePermission` to create custom permissions.
- **Behavior**: The `BaseView`’s `check_permissions` method evaluates each permission class. If any `has_permission` method is missing or returns `False`, a `PermissionDenied` exception is raised, resulting in a 403 Forbidden response.

#### Usage
1. Navigate to the journey map list URL (e.g., `/journeys/`).
2. Ensure you are authenticated (per the default `IsAuthenticated` permission) or meet the requirements of the configured `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS`.
3. View the list of user journeys, with each journey’s name and persona details displayed, and click to access the detailed view.

---

## JourneyMapDetailView

The `JourneyMapDetailView` is a class-based `DetailView` that renders a detailed user journey map, including the associated persona, stages, actions, feedback, pain points, and opportunities, presented in a timeline or structured format.

### Features

#### Template
- **Template Name**: `journey_map_detail.html`
- **Context Object Name**: `journey_data`
- **Description**: Renders a comprehensive view of a single `UserJourney`, including a hierarchical structure of stages and actions, with related feedback, pain points, and opportunities.

#### Queryset
- **Model**: `UserJourney`
- **Optimization**:
  - Uses `select_related("persona")` to fetch the associated `UserPersona`.
  - Uses `prefetch_related` with `Prefetch` objects to efficiently retrieve related `JourneyStage`, `JourneyAction`, `UserFeedback`, `PainPoint`, and `Opportunity` instances in a single query.
  - Stages and actions are ordered by their `order` field using `Prefetch` querysets.
- **Retrieval**: Fetches the journey by `id` using `get_object_or_404`, ensuring a 404 response if the journey does not exist.

#### Context Data
- **Structure**: The `journey_data` context is a dictionary containing:
  - `journey`: The `UserJourney` instance.
  - `persona`: The associated `UserPersona`.
  - `stages`: A list of stage dictionaries, each containing:
    - `stage`: The `JourneyStage` instance.
    - `actions`: A list of action dictionaries, each containing:
      - `action`: The `JourneyAction` instance.
      - `feedbacks`: List of related `UserFeedback` instances.
      - `pain_points`: List of related `PainPoint` instances.
      - `opportunities`: List of related `Opportunity` instances.
- **Efficiency**: Accesses prefetched data directly via `_prefetched_objects_cache` to avoid additional database queries.

#### Access Control
- **Permission Classes**: Defined by `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS`, defaulting to `journey_map.permissions.IsAuthenticated`.
- **Supported Permissions**:
  - Package-specific: `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `IsSuperUser`, `AllowAny` (from `journey_map.permissions`).
  - DRF-style: Any permission class with a `has_permission(self, request, view)` method.
  - Custom: Inherit from `journey_map.permissions.BasePermission` for tailored permissions.
- **Behavior**: Inherits permission checks from `BaseView`. A `PermissionDenied` exception is raised if access is not granted, resulting in a 403 Forbidden response.

#### Usage
1. Navigate to the journey map detail URL (e.g., `/journeys/1/`).
2. Ensure you are authenticated (per the default `IsAuthenticated` permission) or meet the requirements of the configured `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS`.
3. View the detailed journey map, featuring:
   - Journey and persona details.
   - A timeline or structured display of stages and actions.
   - Associated feedback, pain points, and opportunities for each action.

## Configuration Notes

- **Permission Customization**:
  - The default `JOURNEY_MAP_VIEW_PERMISSION_CLASS = "journey_map.permissions.IsAuthenticated"` ensures only authenticated users can access the views.
  - Override `config.view_permission_class` in your Django settings to use other permissions, such as `IsAdminUser`, `IsSuperUser`, `AllowAny`, or a custom class inheriting from `journey_map.permissions.BasePermission`.
  - DRF permission classes (e.g., `rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated`) are supported if DRF is installed.
- **Template Customization**: The `journey_map_list.html` and `journey_map_detail.html` templates can be overridden in your project to customize the UI, such as integrating with charting libraries (e.g., D3.js) or responsive layouts.
- **Query Optimization**: Both views are optimized for performance using `select_related` and `prefetch_related`, minimizing database queries even for complex, nested data.
- **Error Handling**: The views handle invalid journey IDs with a 404 response and unauthorized access with a 403 response, ensuring robust user feedback.
