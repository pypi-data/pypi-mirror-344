class BaseDetector():
    r"""
    A base class representing different types of detectors, providing methods for setup, light coupling calculations,
    rotation adjustments, and generating visual representations such as 3D plots and footprints.

    The `BaseDetector` class serves as the foundational structure for various types of detectors,
    such as integrating spheres or photodiodes. It includes parameters to define the detector's
    configuration, such as numerical aperture (NA), rotational offsets, and the handling of coherent
    light interactions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mode_number : str
        The mode of the detector, typically used to specify the mode of operation for light collection
        (e.g., single-mode, multimode). This defines how the detector interacts with the incoming light.
    NA : Quantity
        The numerical aperture of the detector, a dimensionless number that defines its light-gathering
        ability. Higher NA values indicate a wider acceptance angle for capturing light.
    gamma_offset : Quantity
        The rotational offset in the gamma direction, controlling the angular positioning of the detector
        relative to the scatterer.
    phi_offset : Quantity
        The rotational offset in the phi direction, specifying the azimuthal angle of the detector's
        orientation.
    mean_coupling : bool
        A flag indicating whether the mean value of the coupling is used when calculating the light
        interaction with the scatterer. This is typically set for cases where an average coupling is
        needed over multiple angles or configurations.
    coherent : bool
        Specifies whether the light coupling is calculated coherently. If `True`, the phase information
        of the light is considered, making this relevant for coherent detection systems.
    sampling : Optional[Quantity], default=200 * AU
        The sampling resolution of the detector, controlling how finely the detector's field is sampled
        over the surface. A higher value increases precision but may require more computational resources.
    polarization_filter : Optional[Quantity], default=numpy.nan * degree
        The polarization filter applied to the detected light. If specified, it allows the detector to
        selectively capture light with a particular polarization. If set to `nan`, no filtering is applied.
    rotation : Optional[Quantity], default=90 * degree
        The rotational angle of the detector, defining its orientation relative to the incoming light or
        scatterer. The default value rotates the detector by 90 degrees.
    medium_refractive_index : Optional[Quantity]

    def get_coupling(self, scatterer: BaseScatterer) -> Quantity:
        r"""
        Compute the light coupling between the detector and a scatterer.

        The coupling quantifies the interaction between the field captured by the detector and the scattered field produced by the scatterer. Mathematically, the coupling is calculated as:

        .. math::
            |\iint_{\Omega}  \Phi_{det} \, \Psi_{scat}^* \,  d \Omega|^2

        Where:

        - \( \Phi_{det} \): The capturing field of the detector, representing the sensitivity of the detector to the incoming scattered field.
        - \( \Psi_{scat} \): The scattered field produced by the scatterer.
        - \( \Omega \): The solid angle over which the integration is performed, typically covering the full \( 4\pi \) steradians around the scatterer.
        - \( d\Omega \): The differential solid angle element.

        This integral computes the overlap between the detector's sensitivity pattern and the scattered field, which is then squared to represent the power coupled into the detector.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scatterer : BaseScatterer
            The scatterer object that interacts with the incident light, producing the scattered field.

        Returns
        -------
        Quantity
            The power coupling between the detector and the scatterer, expressed in watts (W). This value represents the amount of scattered power that is captured by the detector.

        Notes
        -----
        - The method internally invokes the appropriate binding method based on the type of scatterer (e.g., Sphere, Cylinder) to calculate the coupling.
        - The coupling depends on both the geometry of the detector and the nature of the scattered field, making it essential for evaluating the efficiency of light collection in scattering experiments.

        Example
        -------
        A common use case is to evaluate how much of the scattered light from a nanoparticle is captured by a photodiode or integrating sphere. The result can be used to estimate the efficiency of light collection for scattering measurements.

        Compute the Poynting vector norm, representing the energy flux density of the electromagnetic field.

        The Poynting vector describes the directional energy transfer per unit area for an electromagnetic wave. It is defined as:

        .. math::
            \vec{S} = \epsilon_0 c^2 \, \vec{E} \times \vec{B}

        Where:

        - \( \vec{S} \): Poynting vector (W/m²)
        - \( \epsilon_0 \): Permittivity of free space (F/m)

        - \( \vec{E} \): Electric field vector (V/m)
        - \( \vec{B} \): Magnetic field vector (T)

        Parameters

        The Poynting vector is computed over a 3D mesh of voxels that cover the entire solid angle of \( 4\pi \) steradians. This method calculates the local energy flux at each voxel and returns the norm, which represents the magnitude of energy flow at each point in space around the scatterer.

        The Poynting vector is fundamental in understanding how energy is transmitted through space in the form of electromagnetic waves.

        Example
        -------
        This method is used to assess the distribution of energy around a scatterer. The total energy flow can be obtained by integrating the Poynting vector over the surface enclosing the scatterer.

        - \( E \): Electric field (V/m)

        scatterer : BaseScatterer
            The scatterer object, which contains information about the scattering properties of the particle, such as geometry and material.
