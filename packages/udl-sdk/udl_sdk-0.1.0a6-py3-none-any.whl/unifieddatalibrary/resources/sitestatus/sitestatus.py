              Link-16 site type specifications (e.g. ADOC, GACC, SOC, TACC, etc.).

          time_function: Description of the time function associated with the reportTime (e.g.
              Activation, Deactivation, Arrival, Departure, etc.), if applicable.

          track_id: The track ID related to this platform (if mobile or transportable), if
