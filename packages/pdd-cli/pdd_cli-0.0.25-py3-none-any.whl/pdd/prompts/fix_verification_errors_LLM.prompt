% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to fix a code_module given a list of potential issues.

% Here is the program that is running the code_module: <program>{program}</program>

% Here is the prompt that generated the program and code_module: <prompt>{prompt}</prompt>

% Here is the code_module that is being used by the program: <code_module>{code}</code_module>

% Here are the output logs from the program run: <output>{output}</output>

% Here are the potential issues that need to be fixed: <issues>{issues}</issues>

% Follow these steps to fix the program or code_module:
    Step 1. Analyze and understand each identified issue in the context of the code_module and program.
    Step 2. For each issue, develop a solution that addresses the root cause while still satisfying the prompt requirements.
    Step 3. Implement the fixes, ensuring the changes resolve the issues without introducing new problems.
    Step 4. Provide the complete fixed code_module and program with explanations for each significant change made.
    Step 5. Verify that the fixed code meets all requirements from the original prompt and addresses all identified issues.

% Write the detail explanation for each step above in a <explanation> XML tag, the fixed code_module in a <fixed_code> XML tag and the fixed program in a <fixed_program> XML tag
