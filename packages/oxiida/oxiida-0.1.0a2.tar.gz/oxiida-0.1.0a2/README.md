`oxiida` is a workflow interpreter for building and controlling processes running on remote resources.
It is opinioned on focusing at running scientific workflows in a high-throughput manner.

- `oxiida` supports run tasks/jobs on local machine, cloud or HPC.
- `oxiida` has native support for Workflow Definition Language (WDL).
- `oxiida` as a language can embed into Python, Julia and Lua to powerup and standard your current workflow setup.

## Installation

### Pre-compiled binaries

Download the Oxiida binary from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oxiida/files/) and place it somewhere in your systemâ€™s `PATH`.

### From a programming language 

If you intend to call Oxiida from Python, <!--Julia, or Lua-->, install the corresponding `oxiida` library:

| Language | Package manager command |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Python   | `pip install oxiida`    |
<!-- | Julia (not yet avail)  | `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Oxiida")` | -->
<!-- | Lua (not yet avail)    | `luarocks install oxiida` | -->

## Disclaimer

The name comes from `oxiida` is the oxidized (it is rusty :crab:) [AiiDA](https://aiida.net), the workflow engine my team are developing.
It is not just another rewrite into rust project, instead I try to redesign it into a standard DSL.
