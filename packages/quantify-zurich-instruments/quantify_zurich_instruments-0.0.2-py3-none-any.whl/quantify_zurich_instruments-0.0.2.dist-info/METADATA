# Quantify Zurich Instruments

## Getting started

To get started, take a look at our [documentation](https://opensource.orangeqs.info/quantify-zurich-instruments/latest/)

## Description
quantify-zurich-instruments is a backend for [quantify](https://quantify-os.org/) that allows the user to compile and execute [quantify schedules](https://quantify-os.org/docs/quantify-scheduler/v0.17.1/user/user_guide.html) on [Zurich Instruments](https://zhinst.com) hardware.
This quantify backend makes use of the [LabOne Q](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/) framework.

This backend is developed by [Orange QS](https://orangeqs.com) and [Zurich Instruments](https://zhinst.com).
