This package aims to provide machine learning (ML) functions for performing comprehensive soil and groundwater data analysis, and for supporting the establishment of effective long-term monitoring. The package includes unsupervised ML for identifying the spatiotemporal patterns of contaminant concentrations (e.g., PCA, clustering), and supervised ML for evaluating the ability of estimating contaminant concentrations based on in situ measurable parameters, as well as the effectiveness of well configuration to capture contaminant concentration distributions. Currently, the main focus is to analyze historical groundwater datasets and to extract key information such as plume behaviors and controlling (or proxy) variables for contaminant concentrations (Schmidt et al., 2018). This is setting a ground for integrating new technologies such as in situ sensors, geophysics and remote sensing data. 

This development is a part of the Advanced Long-Term Monitoring Systems (ALTEMIS) project. In this project, we propose to establish the new paradigm of long-term monitoring based on state-of-art technologies – in situ groundwater sensors, geophysics, drone/satellite-based remote sensing, reactive transport modeling, and AI – that will improve effectiveness and robustness, while reducing the overall cost. In particular, we focus on (1) spatially integrative technologies for monitoring system vulnerabilities – surface cap systems and groundwater/surface water interfaces, and (2) in situ monitoring technologies for monitoring master variables that control or are associated with contaminant plume mobility and direction. This system transforms the monitoring paradigm from reactive monitoring – respond after plume anomalies are detected – to proactive monitoring – detect the changes associated with the plume mobility before concentration anomalies occur.

## Installation

### [Optional] Create a virtual environment within which the package is installed.
It is recommended to install the package and work in a virtual environment. </br>
Read more [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to learn how to install `conda`.
```
conda create --name pylenm_env python=3.8
conda activate pylenm_env
```

Working with Anaconda, you might need to install `jupyter` for Anaconda to identify this env as a jupyter environemnt.
```
pip install jupyter
```

### Installing the `pylenm` package

#### [Option 1] Install directly from the PyPI package repository.
Install directly using `pip` as mentioned on the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/pylenm/).
```
pip install pylenm
```

#### [Option 2] Install from the source code
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ALTEMIS-DOE/pylenm.git
    cd pylenm
    ```

<!-- 2. **Install package dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` -->

2. **Install the package**
    ```
    pip install .
    ```

# Demonstration notebooks
These notebooks use the refactored version of the [`pylenm`](https://github.com/ALTEMIS-DOE/pylenm/tree/satyarth/pylenm) package - [`pylenm2`](https://github.com/ALTEMIS-DOE/pylenm/tree/satyarth/pylenm2).
This refactored version reorganizes the functions into a more semantically separated modules.

To use this version, import `pylenm2` instead of `pylenm` after installation.
The function hirarchy is shown in [pylenm2 README](https://github.com/ALTEMIS-DOE/pylenm/blob/satyarth/pylenm2/README.md).
