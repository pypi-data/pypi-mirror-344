    pip install tools

    import tools as T
    T.save_pickle(data, 'data.p')

Most useful functions are in `tools.tools`\
API dependent tools are in their corresponding folders: `tools.API_name` (i.e. `tools.torch.optim`)

Planning to document using chatGPT,
Not documented yet, so you'll have to look at documents written inside the codes. (Most codes contain explanation)

I'm open to using my tools for any purpose, and I would appreciate it if the users let me know.
Please email me before using it.

I'm happy to discuss questions or suggestions, please contact me via email. :) \
