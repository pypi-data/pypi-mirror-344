Documentation
=============

``concreteproperties`` is a python package that can be used to calculate the section
properties of arbitrary reinforced concrete sections. ``concreteproperties`` can
calculate gross, cracked and ultimate properties. It can perform moment curvature
analyses and generate moment interaction and biaxial bending diagrams. On top of this,
``concreteproperties`` can also generate pretty stress plots!

Here's an example of some of the non-linear output ``concreteproperties`` can generate:
