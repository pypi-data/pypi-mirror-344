# Tx_engine Requirements
Tx_engine was developed from the following "requirements".

* Script
* Script + Script = Script
* Script.parse_string
* Script.raw_serialize
* The debugger (or, more generally, the Context class)

## Requirements Part 2 
* Tx ouput - including script output
* Script output - in the form that can be read in using Script::parse_string
* Tx input signing - issue with for loops and multiple inputs, need to think through
    * remove `clone_py` replace with `copy`
* Tx verify - either using Rust or Python
* Add equality tests (`==`) to Script, Tx, TxIn, TxOut
* Add print __repr__ to Script, Tx, TxIn, TxOut
