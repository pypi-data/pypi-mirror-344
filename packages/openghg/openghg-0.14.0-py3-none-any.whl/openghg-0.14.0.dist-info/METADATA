              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## OpenGHG - a cloud platform for greenhouse gas data analysis and collaboration

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) ![OpenGHG tests](https://github.com/openghg/openghg/workflows/OpenGHG%20tests/badge.svg?branch=master)

OpenGHG is a project based on the prototype [HUGS platform](https://github.com/hugs-cloud/hugs) which aims to be a platform for collaboration and analysis
of greenhouse gas (GHG) data.

The platform will be built on open-source technologies and will allow researchers to collaborate on large datasets by harnessing the
power and scalability of the cloud.

For more information please see [our documentation](https://docs.openghg.org/).

## Install locally

To run OpenGHG locally you'll need Python 3.8 or later on Linux or MacOS, we don't currently support Windows.

You can install OpenGHG using `pip` or `conda`, though `conda` allows the complete functionality to be accessed at once.

## Using `pip`

To use `pip`, first create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv openghg_env
```

Then activate the environment

```bash
source openghg_env/bin/activate
```

It's best to make sure you have the most up to date versions of the packages that `pip` will use behind the scenes when installing OpenGHG.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
```

Then we can install OpenGHG itself

```bash
pip install openghg
```

Each time you use OpenGHG please make sure to activate the environment using the `source` step above.


> **_NOTE:_**  Some functionality is not completely accessible when OpenGHG is installed with `pip`. This only affects some map regridding functionality. See the Additional Functionality section below for more information.

## Using `conda`

To get OpenGHG installed using `conda` we'll first create a new environment

```bash
conda create --name openghg_env
```

Then activate the environment

```bash
conda activate openghg_env
```

Then install OpenGHG and its dependencies from our [conda channel](https://anaconda.org/openghg/openghg)
and conda-forge.

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge --channel openghg openghg
```

Note: the `xesmf` library is already incorporated into the conda install from vx.x onwards and so does not need to be installed separately.

## Create the configuration file

OpenGHG stores object store and user data in a configuration file in the user's home directory at `~/.config/openghg/openghg.conf`. As this sets the path of the object store, the user must
create this file in one of two ways

### Command line

Using the `openghg` command line tool

```
openghg --quickstart

OpenGHG configuration
---------------------

Enter path for object store (default /home/gareth/openghg_store):
INFO:openghg.util:Creating config at /home/gareth/.config/openghg/openghg.conf

INFO:openghg.util:Configuration written to /home/gareth/.config/openghg/openghg.conf
```

### Python

Using the `create_config` function from the `openghg.util` submodule.

```
from openghg.util import create_config

create_config()

OpenGHG configuration
---------------------

Enter path for object store (default /home/gareth/openghg_store):
INFO:openghg.util:Creating config at /home/gareth/.config/openghg/openghg.conf

INFO:openghg.util:Configuration written to /home/gareth/.config/openghg/openghg.conf
```

You will be prompted to enter the path to the object store, leaving the prompt empty tells OpenGHG to use the default path in the user's home directory at `~/openghg_store`.

## Additional functionality

Some optional functionality is available within OpenGHG to allow for multi-dimensional regridding of map data (`openghg.tranform` sub-module). This makes use of the [`xesmf` package](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This Python library is built upon underlying FORTRAN and C libraries (ESMF) which cannot be installed directly within a Python virtual environment.

To use this functionality these libraries must be installed separately. One suggestion for how to do this is as follows.

If still within the created virtual environment, exit this using
```bash
deactivate
```

We will need to create a `conda` environment to contain just the additional C and FORTRAN libraries necessary for the `xesmf` module (and dependencies) to run. This can be done by installing the `esmf` package using `conda`
```bash
conda create --name openghg_add esmf -c conda-forge
```

Then activate the Python virtual environment in the same way as above:
```bash
source openghg_env/bin/activate
```

Run the following lines to link the Python virtual environment to the installed dependencies, doing so by installing the `esmpy` Python wrapper (a dependency of `xesmf`):
```bash
ESMFVERSION='v'$(conda list -n openghg_add esmf | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}')
$ export ESMFMKFILE="$(conda env list | grep openghg_add | awk '{print $2}')/lib/esmf.mk"
$ pip install "git+https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf.git@${ESMFVERSION}#subdirectory=src/addon/ESMPy/"
```

**Note**: The pip install command above for `esmf` module may produce an AttributeError. At present (19/07/2022) an error of this type is expected and may not mean the `xesmf` module cannot be installed. This error will be fixed if [PR #49](https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/pull/49) is merged.

Now the dependencies have all been installed, the `xesmf` library can be installed within the virtual environment

```bash
pip install xesmf
```

## Developers

If you'd like to contribute to OpenGHG please see the contributing section of our documentation. If you'd like to take a look at the source and run the tests follow the steps below.

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openghg/openghg.git
```

### Install dependencies

We recommend you create a virtual environment first

```bash
python -m venv openghg_env
```

Then activate the environment

```bash
source openghg_env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies

```bash
cd openghg
pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Next you can install OpenGHG in editable mode using the `-e` flag. This installs the package from
the local path and means any changes you make to the code will be immediately available when
using the package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

OpenGHG should now be installed in your virtual environment.

See above for additional steps to install the `xesmf` library as required.

### Run the tests

To run the tests

```bash
pytest -v tests/
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Some of the tests require the [udunits2](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) library to be installed.

The `udunits` package is not `pip` installable so we've added a separate flag to specifically run these tests. If you're on Debian / Ubuntu you can do

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudunits2-0
```

#### Running CF Checker tests

You can then run the `cfchecks` marked tests using

```bash
pytest -v --run-cfchecks tests/
```

#### Running ICOS tests

Some of our tests retrieve data from the ICOS Carbon Portal and so to avoid load on the ICOS severs these should not be run frequently. They should only be run when working on this functionality or before a release. These tests are marked `icos` with `pytest.mark`.

```bash
pytest -v --run-icos tests/
```

If all the tests pass then you're good to go. If they don't please [open an issue](https://github.com/openghg/openghg/issues/new) and let us
know some details about your setup.
