- **Typing Effect**: Simulates the effect of typing text character by character.
- **Falling Text**: Coming Soon...
- **Scramble Effect**: Displays random characters that gradually transform into the actual text.
- **Wave Text**: Makes the text move in a wave-like pattern.
- **Untyping Effect**: Gradually erases text character by character.
- **Unfalling Text**: Coming Soon...
- **Unscramble Effect**: The text gradually scrambles into random characters until it disappears.
- **Unwave Text**: The text starts in a wave-like pattern and gradually stabilizes.
