# annual-daylight-enhanced
Annual daylight recipe for Pollination.

Use this recipe to calculate annual daylight for a HBJSON model.

This recipe uses an enhanced 2-phase method for daylight simulation with accurate direct sunlight calculation. If the accuracy of the direct sunlight is not important, you can use the [annual-daylight](https://github.com/pollination/annual-daylight) recipe.

### Versions
There are three different versions of the recipe. All three versions use the same simulation methodology and workflow, although their outputs vary.
