Nytheris Prime orbits a dying violet star on the edge of the Veil Expanse, a region of space where physics begins to unravel. Once a research colony, Nytheris is now abandoned—its atmosphere ionized by ancient energy pulses from subterranean crystal lattices that occasionally whisper in forgotten dialects. Native flora feed on electromagnetic fields, while silicon-based fauna emit low-frequency hums to navigate the chaotic magnetosphere. Rumors persist of sentient weather systems and time fractures in the deeper valleys, where explorers vanish—or return years before they left.
