## 🚀 Usage

```python
from manju_humantime import humanize_time_difference

print(humanize_time_difference(45))          # in 45 seconds
print(humanize_time_difference(3600))         # in 1 hour
print(humanize_time_difference(-86400))       # 1 day ago
print(humanize_time_difference(604800))       # in 1 week
```

## 📚 Example Output

| Seconds         | Output          |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `45`            | in 45 seconds     |
| `3600`          | in 1 hour         |
| `-7200`         | 2 hours ago       |
