## üì± Usage

### Basic Commands

**Take a screenshot:**
```bash
snapdroid -ss
```

**Record the screen for 10 seconds:**
```bash
snapdroid -sr 10
```

**Save to a specific directory:**
```bash
snapdroid -ss --out ~/Screenshots
```

### Advanced Features

**Capture a specific app by package name:**
```bash
snapdroid -ss --package com.example.app
```

**Test background blur in app switcher:**
```bash
snapdroid -ss --background
```

**Record a specific app for 5 seconds:**
```bash
snapdroid -sr 5 --package com.example.banking.app
```

**Show all examples:**
```bash
snapdroid --examples
```

**Show version information:**
```bash
snapdroid --version
```

## üîí Security Testing Use Cases

### Background Blur Testing

Many apps containing sensitive information should implement proper blurring when shown in the app switcher (recent apps) view. SnapDroid makes it easy to test this security feature:

1. Launch the target app:
   ```bash
   snapdroid -ss --package com.example.banking.app --background
   ```

2. SnapDroid will:
   - Launch the specified app
   - Navigate to the app switcher
   - Capture a screenshot
   - Save it locally for analysis

3. Examine the screenshot to verify proper content blurring

This is particularly useful on emulators like older Corellium devices where taking screenshots of the app switcher can be challenging through normal means.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**No device detected:**
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device
- Check connection with `adb devices`
- Try restarting ADB with `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

**Permission denied errors:**
- Make sure your device has authorized the ADB connection
- Check for permission prompts on your device

**App won't launch:**
- Verify the package name is correct
- Try launching the app manually first
