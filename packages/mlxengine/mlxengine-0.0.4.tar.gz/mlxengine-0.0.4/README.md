![alt text](docs/banner.png)

> **Note:** MLX Engine is a fork of [MLX Omni Server](https://github.com/madroidmaq/mlx-omni-server) by [@madroidmaq](https://github.com/madroidmaq), refactored to use TurboAPI and enhance maintainability.

MLX Engine is a local inference server powered by Apple's MLX framework, specifically designed for Apple Silicon (M-series) chips. It implements
OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, enabling seamless integration with existing OpenAI SDK clients while leveraging the power of local ML inference.

## Features

- üöÄ **Apple Silicon Optimized**: Built on MLX framework, optimized for M1/M2/M3/M4 series chips
- üîå **OpenAI API Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API endpoints
- üéØ **Multiple AI Capabilities**:
    - Audio Processing (TTS & STT)
    - Chat Completion
    - Image Generation
- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Local inference with hardware acceleration
- üîê **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- üõ† **SDK Support**: Works with official OpenAI SDK and other compatible clients

## Supported API Endpoints

The server implements OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

- [Chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat): `/v1/chat/completions`
    - ‚úÖ Chat
    - ‚úÖ Tools, Function Calling
    - ‚úÖ Structured Output
    - ‚úÖ LogProbs
    - üöß Vision
- [Audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio)
    - ‚úÖ `/v1/audio/speech` - Text-to-Speech
    - ‚úÖ `/v1/audio/transcriptions` - Speech-to-Text
- [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list)
    - ‚úÖ `/v1/models` - List models
    - ‚úÖ `/v1/models/{model}` - Retrieve or Delete model

    - ‚úÖ `/v1/images/generations` - Image generation

## Installation

```bash
# Install using pip
pip install mlxengine
```

## Quick Start

There are two ways to use MLX Engine:

### Method 1: Using the HTTP Server

1. Start the server:

```bash
# If installed via pip as a package
mlxengine
```

You can use `--port` to specify a different port, such as: `mlxengine --port 10240`. The default port is 10240.

You can view more startup parameters by using `mlxengine --help`.

2. Configure the OpenAI client to use your local server:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure client to use local server
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:10240/v1",  # Point to local server
    api_key="not-needed"  # API key is not required for local server
)
```

### Method 2: Using TestClient (No Server Required)

For development or testing, you can use TestClient to interact directly with the application without starting a server:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient # TODO: Update this import once TurboAPI has TestClient
from mlxengine.main import app

# Use TestClient to interact directly with the application
client = OpenAI(
    http_client=TestClient(app)  # Use TestClient directly, no network service needed
)
```

### Example Usage

Regardless of which method you choose, you can use the client in the same way:

```python
# Chat Completion Example
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What can you do?"}
    ]
)

# Text-to-Speech Example
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx",
    input="Hello, welcome to MLX Engine!"
)

# Speech-to-Text Example
audio_file = open("speech.mp3", "rb")
transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo",
    file=audio_file
)

# Image Generation Example
image_response = client.images.generate(
    model="argmaxinc/mlx-FLUX.1-schnell",
    prompt="A serene landscape with mountains and a lake",
    n=1,
    size="512x512"
)

# Tool Calling Example
import json
from datetime import datetime
from openai import OpenAI

model = "mlx-community/QwQ-32B-4bit" # Make sure this model supports tool calling
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:10240/v1",
    api_key="not-needed"
)

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_delivery_date",
            "description": "Get the delivery date for a customer's order. Call this whenever you need to know the delivery date, for example when a customer asks 'Where is my package'",

                    },
                },
                "required": ["order_id"],
                "additionalProperties": False,

    }

    }

    print("\nTool Response Message (Appended):")
    print(function_call_result_message)

    # Second API call: Send the tool response back to the model
    print("\nSending tool response back to model...")
    completion_with_tool_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
    )
    
    final_assistant_message = completion_with_tool_response.choices[0].message
    print("\nFinal Assistant Response:")
    print(final_assistant_message)

    print("\nAssistant Response (No Tool Call):")
    print(response_message.content)
