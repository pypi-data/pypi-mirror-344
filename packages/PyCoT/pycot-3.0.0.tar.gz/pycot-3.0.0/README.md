# Summary

PyCot is developed to assist and streamline integration with programs that utilize Cursor on Target (CoT). This tool seeks to help generate, validate, and parse XML data that is defined from either MITRE or the MIL-STD.

## Why?

I needed an easy way to interface with CoT messages, I could not find one available.
