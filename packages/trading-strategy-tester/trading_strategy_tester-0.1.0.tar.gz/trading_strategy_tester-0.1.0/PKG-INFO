# Trading Strategy Tester

This project was created as a semester project at Charles University.

## About the project

The Trading Strategy Tester is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of trading strategies using historical market data. It provides a flexible framework that allows users to define various trading conditions, apply different technical indicators, and assess strategy performance through backtesting.

With a user-friendly interface, the tool supports both long and short positions, and it integrates various risk management techniques, such as stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. Users can visualize their strategies' performance through comprehensive graphs and metrics, enabling informed decision-making.

You can find some usage examples [here](examples/).
