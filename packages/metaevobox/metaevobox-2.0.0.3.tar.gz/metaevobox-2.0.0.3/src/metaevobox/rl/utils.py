    A class to store and manage the memory required for reinforcement learning algorithms.

    - __init__(): Initializes the memory by creating empty lists for actions, states, log probabilities, and rewards.
    - clear_memory(): Clears the stored memory by deleting the lists of actions, states, log probabilities, and rewards.

    This class does not raise any exceptions.

    # Introduction
    The `ReplayBuffer` class is a utility for storing and sampling experiences in reinforcement learning. It uses a fixed-size buffer to store transitions (state, action, reward, next state, done) and provides methods to append new experiences and sample mini-batches for training. This class is essential for implementing experience replay, which helps stabilize and improve the learning process in reinforcement learning algorithms.
    # Args
    - `max_size` (int): The maximum number of experiences the buffer can hold.

    - `buffer` (collections.deque): A deque object that stores the experiences with a fixed maximum size.
    # Methods
    - `append(exp)`: Adds a new experience to the buffer.
    - `sample(batch_size)`: Samples a mini-batch of experiences from the buffer.
    - `__len__()`: Returns the current number of experiences stored in the buffer.
    # Raises
    - `ValueError`: Raised in the `sample` method if the requested batch size exceeds the number of stored experiences.

class ReplayBuffer_torch:
    """
    # Introduction
    The `ReplayBuffer_torch` class implements a replay buffer for reinforcement learning using PyTorch. It is designed to store and sample transitions (state, action, reward, next_state, done) efficiently, enabling agents to learn from past experiences. The buffer supports fixed capacity and operates in a circular manner, overwriting old transitions when full.
    # Args
    - `capacity` (int): The maximum number of transitions the buffer can store.
    - `state_dim` (int): The dimensionality of the state space.
    - `device` (torch.device): The device (CPU or GPU) on which the buffer's tensors are stored.
    # Attributes
    - `capacity` (int): The maximum number of transitions the buffer can store.
    - `device` (torch.device): The device (CPU or GPU) on which the buffer's tensors are stored.
    - `position` (int): The current position in the buffer where the next transition will be stored.
    - `size` (int): The current number of transitions stored in the buffer.
    - `states` (torch.Tensor): A tensor storing the states of transitions.
    - `actions` (torch.Tensor): A tensor storing the actions of transitions.
    - `rewards` (torch.Tensor): A tensor storing the rewards of transitions.
    - `next_states` (torch.Tensor): A tensor storing the next states of transitions.
    - `dones` (torch.Tensor): A tensor storing the done flags of transitions.
    # Methods
    - `append(state, action, reward, next_state, done)`: Adds a new transition to the buffer. Overwrites the oldest transition if the buffer is full.
    - `sample(batch_size)`: Samples a batch of transitions from the buffer.
    - `__len__()`: Returns the current number of transitions stored in the buffer.
    # Returns
    - `sample(batch_size)`: Returns a tuple of tensors `(states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones)` representing a batch of sampled transitions.
    # Raises
    - No explicit exceptions are raised by this class.
