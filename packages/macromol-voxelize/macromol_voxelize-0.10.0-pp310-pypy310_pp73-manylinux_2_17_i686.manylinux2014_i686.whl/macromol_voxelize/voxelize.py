class ImageParams:
    """\
    A collection of parameters that apply to the image as a whole, as opposed
    to individual atoms.

    The most important parameters are `channels` and `grid`.  Together, these 
    specify the dimensions of the image.  The remaining parameters have 
    reasonable defaults.

    .. attribute:: channels
        :type: int

        The number of channels in the image.

        Note that this must be consistent with the *channels* column of the 
        *atoms* data frame passed to `image_from_atoms()`.  An error will be 
        raised if any atoms have channel indices that exceed the actual number 
        of channels, or are negative.

    .. attribute:: grid
        :type: Grid
        
        The spatial dimensions of the image.

    .. attribute:: dtype
        :type: Type[numpy.floating]
        :value: numpy.float32

        The data type used to encode each voxel of the image.

        The following data types are supported:

        - `numpy.float32`, a.k.a. `numpy.single`
        - `numpy.float64`, a.k.a. `numpy.double`

        Note that 64-bit (i.e. double-precision) floating point numbers are 
        always used for the intermediate calculations needed to fill in each 
        voxel.  According to the overlap_ library, which implements most of 
        these calculations, "reducing the numerical precision of the scalar 
        floating point type will have a significant impact on the precision and 
        stability of the calculations".  Therefore, this setting only affects 
        the precision used to store the final result, and in turn the size of 
        the final image.

    .. attribute:: max_radius_A
        :type: Optional[float]
        :value: None

        The maximum radius to use when filtering atoms that are outside the 
        image, in units of angstroms.

        If not specified, the maximum radius will be calculated from the 
        *radius_A* column of the *atoms* dataframe passed to 
        `image_from_atoms()`.  The main reason to specify this parameter is to 
        allow *radius_A* to be calculated after the initial filtering step, 
        which can be more efficient.  Note that an error will be raised if any 
        atoms in the image have radii larger than this maximum (and if 
        ``__debug__ == True``).

    .. attribute:: fill_algorithm
        :type: FillAlgorithm
        :value: FillAlgorithm.FractionAtom

        The algorithm used to calculate a value for each voxel in the image.  
        The following values are supported:

        - ``FillAlgorithm.OverlapA3``: The volume of overlap between the voxel 
          and any atoms, in units of Å³.

        - ``FillAlgorithm.FractionAtom``: The number (usually fractional) of 
          atoms contained in the voxel.  A nice property of this algorithm is 
          that the sum of all the voxels in the image will match the number of 
          atoms used to make it.

        - ``FillAlgorithm.FractionVoxel``: The fraction of the voxel that is 
          occupied by atoms.  This is calculated separately for each atom, 
          then summed, so the result can be greater than 1.

    .. attribute:: agg_algorithm
        :type: AggAlgorithm
        :value: AggAlgorithm.Sum

        The algorithm used to aggregate a new fill value for a voxel with the 
        existing value of that voxel.

        - ``AggAlgorithm.Sum``: Sum the two values.  This results in 
          meaningful volumes/fractions when a voxel is partially occupied by 
          two different atoms.

        - ``AggAlgorithm.Max``: Keep the higher of the two values.  This may 
          give more reasonable results than summing when there are lots of 
          overlapping atoms.

            - *radius_A* (required): The radius of each atom, in units of 
              angstroms.  The `set_atom_radius_A()` function can be used to 
              create this column, if necessary.

              belongs to, expressed as a list of integers.  Each atom can 
              belong to any number of channels.  Each channel index must be

              image only has one channel (i.e. ``img_params.channels == 1``), 
              this column is optional.

            - *occupancy* (optional): How "present" each atom is.  More 
              specifically, this is a factor that will be used to scale the

    The primary reason to use this function is to save a little bit of time by

    be wasteful for large structures, where only a small fraction of the atoms 
    participate in the final image.

    This function is typically followed by `image_from_all_atoms()`, not 
    `image_from_atoms()`, to avoid needlessly repeating this filtering step.  
    Be careful not to modify the *x*, *y*, *z*, or *radius_A* columns of the
