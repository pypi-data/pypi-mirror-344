Quick Start
===========

Installation & Dependencies 
---------------------------

.. TODO: 
    Remove following warning for v0.1.0 release.

.. warning::
    Until visionsim goes public, it will not be accessible on PyPI. Please use the :doc:`development instructions for installation <../development>` in the meantime.  

The recommended way to get visionsim is to **install the latest stable release** via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_::
    
    $ pip install visionsim


We currently support **Python 3.9+**. Users still on Python 3.8 or older are
urged to upgrade.



You'll also need:

* `Blender <https://www.blender.org/download/>`_ >= 3.3.1, to render new views. 
* `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_, for visualizations. 


Make sure Blender and ffmpeg are on your PATH.

The first time you use the renderer, it may ask you to install additional packages into blender's runtime.

Generating a dataset
--------------------

To give you a taste of how visionsim works, we will create a small scale dataset of a toy lego truck as if it was captured by a realistic 25fps conventional RGB camera and a 4kHz single photon camera for 4 seconds. To achieve this, we will:  

- Render a small dataset of 500 ground truth frames using the ``blender.render-animation`` CLI,
- Interpolate this dataset 32-fold using the ``interpolate.frames`` CLI,
- And emulate different cameras using the ``emulate.rgb/spad/event`` CLIs.

Rendering Ground Truth
----------------------

First, download the test scene, here we will be using the lego truck (of the `NeRF <https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf>`_ fame) which you can download from `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gRxhL3rbGDTfgKytre8WkbBu-QDJFy15?usp=sharing>`_. This blender file has been modified to include an HDR skybox and a camera animation. Specifically, the camera moves along a circular obit at Z=1 with radius=5 that points towards the origin and lasts 100 frames. Here, we assume your blender file is per-animated, but you can control camera movements and keyframes manually too. 


To create the lego dataset, we'll slow down the camera movement by a factor of 5x and render 500 RGB frames: 

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 3

.. note::
    The ``blender.render-animation`` CLI has a lot of options which enable changing render settings and resolution, parallelization, and for generating different types of ground truth annotations such as depth and segmentation maps. You can see all options by running the following::

        $ visionsim --help blender.render-animation

    If the above command does not work, you might have to change some settings, notably the ``device`` type.
    
    Finer grain control can be had using the :class:`BlenderClient API <visionsim.simulate.blender.BlenderClient>`.

.. warning:: This might take a while, with blender 4.2 on a RTX 3080 it takes about 18 minutes. 

All the rendered frames will be in ``quickstart/lego-gt/frames``, and alongside this directory you should see a ``transforms.json`` file which contains metadata and information about the camera trajectory used for rendering. 

Let's create a quick preview of this dataset by animating every 5th frame into a video, this allows for realtime play back without creating a video with a very fast framerate:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 4

The file ``preview.mp4`` should show a nice turntable-style animation of a lego truck (shown here as a GIF made with `gifski <https://gif.ski/>`_, yours should look better):

.. image:: _static/lego-gt-preview.gif
    :align: center
    :width: 75%

Interpolating Frames
--------------------

You can optionally interpolate an existing dataset in order to get intermediate frames that have not been rendered. This enables us to quickly increase the effective framerate of the data at the cost of potentially introducing artifacts if frames are too "far" apart. The following will interpolate a dataset by a factor of 32x:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 5

This is much faster than rendering new frames, but can still be a bit slow. The above takes about 10 minutes on an RTX 3080.  

You can preview this new dataset like above, just use a step of 160 (=5x32) to ensure playback is at the same speed. 

.. note::
    The new dataset actually contains 15,969 frames and not 16,000 which might be a little surprising at first as one might expect 32x500=16,000 frames. But consider the case where you interpolate two frames by a factor of 2x. You'll create a new frame between every existing frame pairs, which will give you 3 frames total, the first original frame, the interpolated frame, and the second original frame. In general, for M original frames interpolated N-times you'll get NM-N+1 frames after interpolation.  
    
.. warning::
    Interpolation can introduce artifacts adjacent frames in the original dataset are too different from one another. This effect and it's implications are further discussed in the :doc:`sections/interpolation` section. In general, interpolation is useful for higher frame rates, it can help bridge the gap between 1,000fps to 10,000fps, not from 10fps to 100fps.

Emulating Sensor Data
---------------------

To simulate a real camera, we must convert these "perfect" RGB frames into realistic motion blurred frames with read noise and quantization artifacts.

We use ``emulate.rgb`` to create the RGB data with motion blur. The ``chunk-size`` argument determines how many frames to average together. Below we are averaging frames from the interpolated dataset in groups of 160, so since the interpolated dataset corresponds to a frame rate of 4,000fps, this means these frames will simulate a 25fps RGB camera:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 6

Next, we can emulate a single-photon camera using ``emulate.spad``, at the same framerate as the interpolated dataset like so:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 7

Here, we pass in ``--mode=img`` to save individual binary frames as PNGs, this makes for easy visualization but requires a lot of disk space as single photon images are not well compressed by standard image formats. See :ref:`the-npy-format` for a better alternative. 

Finally, let's emulate an event camera using ``emulate.events``, which responds to local changes in scene intensity:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.sh 
   :language: bash 
   :lines: 8

Let's look at the results:
