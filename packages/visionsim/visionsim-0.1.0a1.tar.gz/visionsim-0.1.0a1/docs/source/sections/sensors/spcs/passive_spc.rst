Passive Single Photon Camera
============================


What's a single photon camera?
------------------------------

Single photon cameras (SPCs) are an emerging class of sensors that offer extreme sensitivity and are manufactured at scale using existing CMOS techniques. These sensors can not only detect individual photons but also time them with picosecond accuracy, enabling applications that are `not possible with traditional sensors <https://wisionlab.com/project/burst-vision-single-photon/>`_. By sensing individual photons, SPCs provide us with the most fine-grained visual information possible and provides a lot of flexibility to the authors of downstream inference tasks.

However, today there exists no easy way to simulate SPCs under a wide range of settings efficiently and at scale, which severely impedes rapid development of new techniques and limiting their adoption. This work aims to provide such tools to the community in order to facilitate the development of new SPC-based techniques and provide a standardized way to do so.
