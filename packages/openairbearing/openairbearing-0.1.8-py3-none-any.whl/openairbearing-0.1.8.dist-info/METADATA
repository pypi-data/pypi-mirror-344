## Introduciton
OpenAirbearing includes a backed to model porous bearing performance and a browser GUI to display the results.
Software can be used online at https://www.openairbearing.com in a limited capability, and in full capability when used locally.

Supported features include:
* Circular thrust bearings
* Annular thrust bearings and seals
* Infinitely long linear bearings and seals
* Rectangular bearings

## Mathematical modeling
Analytical and numerical solutions of the Reynolds equation in one dimension fort most common porous gas bearing and seal geometries.
Analytical solutions assume ideal geometry, numerical (finite difference method) solutions consider uneven gap height, uneven permeability, and slip at porous-gap interface.
Implements models from textbooks [1,2] and research of Miettinen et al. [3,4].

## Installation

Python is required to use OpenAirBearing. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).

OpenAirBearing can be installed using the Python package installer ``pip`` (https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install openairbearing
    
Alternatively, ``git`` can be used to clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Aalto-Arotor/openTorsion.git
    
This creates a folder *openairbearing* containing the OpenAirBearing source code.

## Quickstart

OpenAirbearing userinterface can be accessed with the following:

    python3
    from openairbearing import app
    app.run()

This lauches the Dash application, which can be accessed at:
