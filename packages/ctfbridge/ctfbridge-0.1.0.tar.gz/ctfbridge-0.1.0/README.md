# CTF Bridge

CTF Bridge is a Python library for interacting with multiple CTF platforms through a unified interface.

⚠️ This project is still in development ⚠️

## Overview

CTFBridge provides a simple, unified API to interact with different Capture the Flag (CTF) competition platforms like CTFd and more.

It hides platform-specific quirks and gives you consistent access to challenges, submissions, and authentication across platforms.

## Features

- 🌟 Unified API across different CTF platforms
- 📄 Fetch challenges, attachments, and challenge metadata
- 🔑 Handle logins, sessions, and authentication cleanly
- ⚡ Automatic rate-limiting and retry handling
- 🧩 Easy to extend with new platform clients
- 🧪 Demo client for quick testing without external servers

## Installation

```bash
pip install ctfbridge
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from ctfbridge import CTFdClient

client = CTFdClient(base_url="https://demo.ctfd.io")
client.login(username="admin", password="password")

challenges = client.get_challenges()
for chal in challenges:
    print(f"[{chal.category}] {chal.name} - {chal.value} points")
```

### Optional: Automatic Platform Detection

If you don't know which platform you are connecting to, you can use `get_client()` to auto-detect and connect automatically.

```python
from ctfbridge import get_client

client = get_client("https://demo.ctfd.io")
client.login("admin", "password")

challenges = client.get_challenges()
for chal in challenges:
    print(f"[{chal.category}] {chal.name} ({chal.value} points)")
```
