- Support for multiple units (mm, cm, m, etc.)
- Built-in exception handling
- Modular and extensible structure

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install mensurapy
``` 

## 🛠 Usage

```python
from mensurapy import area, perimeter, surface_area, volume

print(area("rectangle", "5m", "10m"))           # 50.0 m²
print(perimeter("circle", "7cm"))               # 43.96 cm
print(surface_area("cube", "4m"))               # Total Surface Area: 96.0 m²
print(volume("cylinder", "3m", "10m"))          # 282.74 m³
```
