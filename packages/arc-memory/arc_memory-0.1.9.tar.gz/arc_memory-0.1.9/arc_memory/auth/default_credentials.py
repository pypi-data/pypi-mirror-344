"""Default credentials for Arc Memory authentication.

This module contains the default Client ID for the Arc Memory GitHub OAuth app.
This is used when no other Client ID is provided.

Following GitHub's best practices for CLI applications, we only embed the Client ID,
which is considered public information. The Client Secret is not required for the
Device Flow authentication used by CLI applications.
