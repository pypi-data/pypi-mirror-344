2. **Hover-Based Interface** - The primary interaction model is through hover cards in diff views, aligning with the "ambient interface" philosophy.

3. **Local-First Processing** - All processing happens locally, ensuring privacy and speed, which is a key differentiator.

4. **Event-Based Architecture** - The implementation uses an event system for communication between components, particularly for cache invalidation.

5. **Prefetching and Caching** - To meet the 500ms performance target, the extension implements prefetching and caching of trace information.

6. **Ollama Integration for AI Features** - Using Ollama for local LLM capabilities ensures privacy while providing AI-powered features.

7. **Progressive Enhancement** - The extension is designed to work without AI features if Ollama is not available, with graceful degradation.
