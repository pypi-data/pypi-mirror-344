This project uses the following methods and transformations:
- **Yeo-Johnson Transformation**: As described in:
  - Yeo, I. K., & Johnson, R. (2000). A New Family of Power Transformations to Improve Normality or Symmetry. Biometrika, 87(4), 954-959.

- **Z-Score Removal**: Remove outliers based on Z-scores that exceed a threshold (default 3.0).
  
- **Z-Score Capper**: Cap values based on Z-scores exceeding a threshold.

- **Yeo-Johnson Removal**: Apply Yeo-Johnson transformation and remove outliers based on Z-scores.

- **Yeo-Johnson Capper**: Apply Yeo-Johnson transformation and cap outliers.

- **Impact Reduction**: Cap outlier values to reduce their impact based on mean and standard deviation.

- **Adaptive Trimming**: Trim values that lie outside of the Interquartile Range (IQR) and replace them with the column mean.

- **Smooth Boundary Capping**: Softly cap outliers towards the boundary, with a smoothing factor.

- **Local Standardization Correction**: Apply local standardization using a rolling window to correct outliers based on local statistics.
