## Project Overview

**MetaScout** is a comprehensive metadata security analyzer designed for detecting, analyzing, and securing sensitive information hidden in file metadata across multiple file formats. The tool extracts deep metadata from images, documents, PDFs, audio, video, and executable files, identifying privacy risks and security concerns while providing reporting and redaction capabilities.

## Installation

MetaScout requires Python 3.8 or later and can be installed using several methods:

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the base package
pip install metascout

# Install with all optional dependencies
pip install "metascout[full]"

# Install specific feature sets
pip install "metascout[document,executable]"
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ParleSec/metascout.git
cd metascout

# Install the package
pip install .

# Or install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### Windows

On Windows, the package installs the `metascout.exe` script to your Python Scripts directory. If this directory is not in your PATH, you can:

```bash
# Add to PATH (PowerShell)
$env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3x\Scripts"

# Or run with full path
$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3x\Scripts\metascout.exe
```

#### Linux/macOS

On Unix-like systems, ensure you have the required build dependencies for certain optional packages:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libmagic-dev libfuzzy-dev

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install libmagic ssdeep
```

### Available Feature Sets

MetaScout uses optional dependencies for specialized features:

- `document`: Dependencies for enhanced document analysis
- `executable`: Dependencies for executable file analysis
- `security`: Enhanced security analysis features (YARA, ssdeep)
- `full`: All optional dependencies

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that MetaScout is working correctly:

```bash
# Check version
metascout --version

# Run self-tests
metascout test

# Test analyze command with a sample file
metascout analyze path/to/any/file.jpg
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation issues, try these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and in your PATH:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. If you get "command not found" errors:
   ```bash
   # Find where the metascout script was installed
   pip show metascout
   
   # Use python module directly
   python -m metascout
   ```

3. For dependency issues with optional packages:
   ```bash
   # Skip problematic dependency
   pip install metascout --no-deps
   pip install -r requirements.txt --skip-failed
   ```

## Purpose & Motivation

### Why MetaScout Exists

Files contain more information than you can see. Behind the visible content lies metadata - information about who created the file, when, where, with what software, and sometimes even location data or personally identifiable information (PII). MetaScout exposes this hidden information to:

- Identify privacy leaks in files before sharing them
- Detect potential security risks in received documents
- Create clean copies of files with sensitive metadata removed
- Verify file authenticity and identify potential manipulation
- Support compliance requirements for handling personal data

MetaScout is particularly valuable for security professionals, privacy-conscious individuals, and organizations that need to ensure documents they create or share don't contain unintentional leaks of sensitive information.

## Architecture

### System Structure

- `core/`: Core data models and processing logic
  - `models.py`: Data models for file metadata and findings
  - `processor.py`: Core file processing logic
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for hashing, file operations, etc.
- `extractors/`: File-specific metadata extractors
  - `base.py`: Base extractor interface
  - `image.py`, `document.py`, `audio.py`, etc.: Format-specific extractors
- `analyzers/`: Analysis modules for different security concerns
  - `base.py`: Base analyzer interface
  - `pattern.py`: Pattern matching for PII detection
  - `image.py`, `document.py`, etc.: Format-specific analyzers
- `operations/`: High-level operations (analyze, batch, compare, redact)
- `reporters/`: Report generators for different output formats
- `config/`: Configuration and constants
- `cli.py`: Command-line interface

The modular design ensures each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and extensible. New file formats, analysis techniques, or output formats can be added with minimal changes to the core system.

    dates: {'DateTimeOriginal': '2025:04:15 14:32:45'}
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
# Process all files in a directory recursively
metascout batch /path/to/files --recursive

# Process only JPG files, excluding thumbnails
metascout batch /data/photos --filter "*.jpg" --exclude "*thumb*" --recursive

# Generate an HTML report for all documents
