class OpenAIPlugin(PyttmanPlugin):
    """
    The OpenAIPlugin offers seamless integrations with the OpenAI API.
    Use the plugin to define pre-prompts that can be used to pre- or post
    process your message in your Pyttman application.

    An example is to use a pre-defined system prompt to correct spelling
    mistakes before the message is passed to the intent matching system.

    Another example is to use the GPT as a post-processor, to generate
    a response based on the intent matched by the Pyttman application.

    Or - use the GPT to generate a response from scratch, when no intent
    matches the user's message. This would be a great way to combine the
    rule-based intent matching system with an AI model.

    The plugin supports RAG: conversational mode. When this is enabled, the
    plugin will keep a conversation history for each user in memory, and
    use this history to generate responses. This can be useful to keep
    the conversation flowing naturally, and to keep the context of the
    conversation intact. While recommended, it's important to note that
    the data is stored in memory, non-encrypted, and will be lost when
    the application is restarted.

    :param api_key: The OpenAI API key to use for the plugin.
    :param model: The model to use for the OpenAI API. For valid options,
        see OpenAI's API documentation.
    :param system_prompt: A system prompt to use for the OpenAI API. Set
        this to configure your app behavior.
    :param max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to use for the OpenAI API.
    :param enable_conversations: Enable RAG: conversational mode. This will
        keep a conversation history for each user,
        greatly improving the experience for conversational applications.
        Disable for stateless apps.
    :param enable_memories: Enable memory making. This will allow the AI to
        remember details about the user, automatically.
        To define custom functions for CRUD operations with memory to use
        a database or other source, provide the callbacks for the plugin to use.
    :param max_conversation_length: The maximum length of the conversation
        history to keep in memory. When the conversation history exceeds this
        length, the memory is truncated oldest first, making for a seamless
        experience.
    :param allowed_intercepts: A list of PyttmanPluginIntercept enums that
        define when the plugin should be executed in the Pyttman application.
        Use these intercepts to align the system prompts you set, with
        the time of execution in the Pyttman application. For example,
        use PyttmanPluginIntercept.before_router to correct spelling mistakes
        or otherwise pre-process the message before it's sent on to the intents.
        In this case, the system prompt could be a spell-checker prompt,
        return the message to the user spell corrected and otherwise intact.
        Stack multiple plugins with different intercept points to create
        a powerful AI system.
    :param time_aware: Set to True if the plugin should be aware of the current
        datetime. If True, the system prompt will be prepended with the current
        datetime, making the AI aware of the time of day. This can really
        improve the experience since the AI can reason about when things
        occur, and you can introduce reasoning about future and past events
        with the AI.
    :param time_zone: The timezone to use for the time awareness. If not set,
        the system will use the system timezone.
