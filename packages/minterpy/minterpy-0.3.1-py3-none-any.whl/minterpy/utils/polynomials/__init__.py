"""
This subpackage contains routines used in the calculations by polynomials.

The routines are organized according to the polynomial bases in their own
respective module.

Notes
-----
- By convention, the functions included in the modules operate on the
  "NumPy-arrays"-level and not on instances of Minterpy classes (e.g.,
  ``MultiIndexSet``, ``NewtonPolynomial``, ``LagrangePolynomial``).
