# SplitExpense

**SplitExpense** is a lightweight, user-friendly desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library. It simplifies the process of splitting group expenses, making it ideal for roommates, travel groups, or any situation where shared expenses occur. The app allows users to add participants, record expenses, and instantly calculate who owes whom. Additionally, it offers the capability to export detailed and summary reports to Excel for easy sharing and record-keeping.

## ✨ Features

- **Add Participants and Expenses**: Easily input the names of individuals involved and the expenses incurred.
- **Assign Payments and Participants**: Specify who paid for what and who participated in each expense.
- **Calculate Balances**: Automatically compute the net balance for each person, indicating how much they owe or are owed.
- **Export to Excel**: Generate detailed and summary reports in Excel format for transparency and record-keeping.
- **Offline Functionality**: Operates entirely offline, ensuring privacy and accessibility without the need for an internet connection.
