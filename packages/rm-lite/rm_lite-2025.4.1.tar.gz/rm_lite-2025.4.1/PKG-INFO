A mini fork of RM-Tools - RM-synthesis, RM-clean and QU-fitting on polarised
radio spectra.

This just exposes a Python API. No plotting, I/O utilities, or CLI are provided.
See the main fork of [RM-Tools](https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM-Tools) for
that functionality.

The goal of this project is to provide low code surface area with high
reliability, performance, and developer ergonomics.

_**Warning:** This is very much a work-in-progress. Do not expect stability for
a while._

## Installation

PyPI release:

```
pip install rm-lite
```

Current GitHub `main` commit:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/AlecThomson/rm-lite.git
```

## Citing

If you use this package in a publication, please cite main fork's
[ASCL entry](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ascl.soft05003P/abstract) for
the time being.

## License

MIT

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be
posted to the GitHub issues page.

The development dependencies can be installed via `pip` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install "rm-lite[dev]"
```

or for a local clone:

```bash
cd rm-lite
pip install ".[dev]"
```

Code formatting and style is handled by `ruff`, with tests run by `pytest`. A
`pre-commit` hook is available to handle the autoformatting. After installing
the `dev` dependencies, you can install the hooks by running:

```bash
cd rm-lite
pre-commit install
```
