# TODO: Plan-Lint Enhancements

This document outlines planned enhancements and improvements for the plan-lint project.

## Policy Framework Enhancements

- [ ] **Policy Engine Improvements**
  - [ ] Clarify separation between core engine and domain-specific policies
  - [ ] Add support for custom policy functions beyond basic rules
  - [ ] Provide extensible policy templates to help users get started
  - [ ] Build validation metrics to identify most triggered policy rules

- [x] **Policy Authoring Tools**
  - [x] Create a policy linting system to validate policy correctness
  - [x] Implement a policy testing framework to verify policy behavior
  - [x] Add policy registration mechanism for managing multiple policies
  - [x] Build documentation generator for policies

- [x] **OPA/Rego Integration**
  - [x] Add support for Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies written in Rego
  - [x] Create translators between YAML policies and Rego policies
  - [x] Implement Rego evaluation engine adapter
  - [x] Add examples of Rego policy patterns (without domain-specific content)

- [ ] **Pluggable Storage Backend**
  - [ ] Create interface for policy storage backends
  - [ ] Implement file system storage provider
  - [ ] Add support for database storage (SQL, MongoDB)
  - [ ] Implement cloud storage providers (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
  - [ ] Add versioning and rollback capabilities for policies

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement batch validation to handle multiple plans concurrently
  - [ ] Add caching for frequently validated plan patterns
  - [ ] Profile and optimize regex matching for better performance with large plans
  - [ ] Investigate GPU acceleration for large-scale validation

## Integration Enhancements

- [ ] **Framework Integration**
  - [ ] Create SDK adapters for popular agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI)
  - [ ] Build CI/CD plugins for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
  - [ ] Develop a standalone web service with REST API for remote validation

- [ ] **Security Incident Reporting**
  - [ ] Implement a reporting mechanism for detected security issues
  - [ ] Create integration with SIEM systems
  - [ ] Add logging compatibility with popular security monitoring tools
  - [ ] Develop threat intelligence sharing capabilities
  - [ ] Create customizable alerting system for critical violations

## User Experience

- [ ] **Visualization and Reporting**
  - [ ] Create a web UI dashboard for visualizing plan validation results
  - [ ] Add report export functionality (PDF, HTML, JSON)
  - [ ] Implement historical validation tracking for identifying patterns over time
  - [ ] Add visual indicators of risk severity and policy compliance

- [ ] **Advanced Validation Features**
  - [ ] Add natural language explanations of why plans were rejected
  - [ ] Implement automatic plan repair suggestions to fix security issues
  - [ ] Create differential validation to compare plan changes
  - [ ] Add plan simulation capabilities to test execution outcomes

## Documentation and Testing

- [x] **Extended Documentation**
  - [x] Create a comprehensive tutorial series on policy authoring
  - [x] Document policy engine extension points for custom integrations
  - [x] Develop animated visualizations of the validation process
  - [x] Create policy authoring guidelines and best practices

- [ ] **Testing Enhancements**
  - [ ] Expand test coverage with more edge cases
  - [ ] Create a validation benchmark suite with known-vulnerable plans
  - [ ] Implement property-based testing for policy engine
  - [ ] Add continuous fuzzing for validation functions

## Advanced Features

- [ ] **Ecosystem Tools**
  - [ ] Build a policy generator wizard to help users create policies
  - [ ] Create a web-based playground for testing policies against sample plans
  - [ ] Develop a VS Code extension for in-editor policy authoring and testing

- [ ] **Machine Learning Enhancements**
  - [ ] Train a model to identify potentially risky patterns not covered by explicit policies
  - [ ] Implement anomaly detection for unusual plan structures
  - [ ] Build adaptive risk scoring based on historical validation data

- [ ] **Compliance Helpers**
  - [ ] Add example policy patterns for common compliance requirements (without full implementation)
  - [ ] Create compliance documentation helpers
  - [ ] Implement policy coverage analysis for compliance requirements
