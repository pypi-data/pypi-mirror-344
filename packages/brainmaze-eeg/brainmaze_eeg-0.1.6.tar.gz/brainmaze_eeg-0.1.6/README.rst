BrainMaze: Brain Electrophysiology, Behavior and Dynamics Analysis Toolbox - EEG
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This toolbox provides tools for processing of intracranial EEG recordings. See below and documentation for specific sections. This tool was separated from the BrainMaze toolbox to support a convenient and lightweight sharing of these tools across projects.

This project was originally developed as a part of the `BEhavioral STate Analysis Toolbox (BEST) <https://github.com/bnelair/best-toolbox>`_ project. However, the development has transferred to the BrainMaze project.



Documentation
"""""""""""""""

Documentation is available `here <https://bnelair.github.io/brainmaze_eeg>`_.


Installation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install brainmaze-eeg

How to contribute
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The project has 2 main protected branches *main* that contains official software releases and *dev* that contains the latest feature implementations shared with developers.
To implement a new feature a new branch should be created from the *dev* branch with name pattern of *developer_identifier/feature_name*.

After the feature is implemented, a pull request can be created to merge the feature branch into the *dev* branch with. Pull requests need to be reviewed by the code owners.
Drafting of new releases will be performed by the code owners in using pull request from *dev* to *main* and drafting a new release on GitHub.

New functions need to be implemented with Sphinx compatible docstrings. The documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings using Sphinx using make_docs.sh either calling its contents.
Documentation source is in docs_src/ and the generated documentation is in docs/. .doctrees is not shared in the repository.

Troubleshooting
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If updating the docs web generated using sphinx, there might be a lot of changes resulting in a buffer hang up. Using SSH over HTTPS is preferred. If you are using HTTPS, you can increase the buffer size by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git config http.postBuffer 524288000
