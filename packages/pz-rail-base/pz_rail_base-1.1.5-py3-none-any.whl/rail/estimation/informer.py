"""
Abstract base classes for Informers.
These superstages ingest prior information, including training sets and explicit
priors, and prepare a model that can be used to produce photo-z data products.
They are distinguished by their input data types, and the models they output can
be used for their corresponding Estimator, Summarizer, or Classifier stages.
