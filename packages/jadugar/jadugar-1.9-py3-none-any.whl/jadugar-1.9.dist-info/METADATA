```python
from file.file2 import read_file, export_file, remote_read, remote_export, all_files

data = read_file("File.txt") #read file from module folder

remote_data= remote_read("docker.txt") #read file from remote storage

all_files() #list all files in module folder

export_file("File.txt") #export file to current directory

remote_export("docker.txt") #export file to current direct from remote storage 

```


here text files present in module folder can only be accessed and external files accessing is currently not supported.

Future Direction, 
1) Accessing file from Cloud Storage
2) Dynamically add text files on cloud storage with help of module
3) Interact with GenAI like Chatgpt, Cluade and Gemini.
