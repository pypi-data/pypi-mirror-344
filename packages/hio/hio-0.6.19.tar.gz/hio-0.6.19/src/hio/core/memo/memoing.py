hio.core.memoing Module

Mixin Base Classes that add support for  memograms over datagram based transports.
In this context, a memogram is a larger memogram that is partitioned into
smaller parts as transport specific datagrams. This allows larger messages to
be transported over datagram transports than the underlying transport can support.

Provide mixin classes.
Takes of advantage of multiple inheritance to enable mixtures of behaviors
with minimal code duplication (more DRY).

New style python classes use the C3 linearization algorithm. Multiple inheritance
forms a directed acyclic graph called a diamond graph. This graph is linarized
into the method resolution order.
Use class.mro() or class.__mro__

(see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/method-resolution-order-in-python-inheritance/)
Basically:
* children always precede their parents
* immediate parent classes of a child are visited in the order listed in the
child class statement.
* a super class is visited only after all sub classes have been visited
* linearized graph is monotonic (a class is only visted once)

Datagram IP Fragmentation
https://packetpushers.net/blog/ip-fragmentation-in-detail/
Only the first fragment contains the header that is needed to defragment at
the other end.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24045424/when-acting-on-a-udp-socket-what-can-cause-sendto-to-send-fewer-bytes-than-re
Answer is that UDP sendto always sends all the bytes but does not make a distinction
between nonblocking and blocking calls to sendto.
Other documentation seems to indicate that sendto when non-blocking may not
send all the bytes.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socket.sendto?view=net-9.0

http://esp32.io/viewtopic.php?t=2378
For UDP, sendto() will try to allocate a packet buffer to hold the full
UDP packet of the size requested (up to 64KB) and will return with errno=ENOMEM
if this fails. Otherwise, provided FD_ISSET(sock, &write_set) is set then the
sendto() will succeed. But you should check for this failure.
Generally if the ESP32 is not low on free memory then you won't see ENOMEM here.

Every call to send must send less that sf::UdpSocket::MaxDatagramSize bytes --
which is a little less than 2^16 (65536) bytes.

https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~westall/853/notes/udpsend.pdf
However, the existence of the UDP and IPmid = uuid.uuid4().bytes  # 16 byte random uuid

headers should also limit.

Maximum IPV4 header size is 60 bytes and UDP header is 8 bytes so maximum UDP
datagram payload size is  65535 - 60 - 8 = 65467

With ipv6 the IP headers are done differently so maximum payload size is
65,535 - 8 = 65527

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1098897/what-is-the-largest-safe-udp-packet-size-on-the-internet
The maximum safe UDP payload is 508 bytes. This is a packet size of 576
(the "minimum maximum reassembly buffer size"), minus the maximum 60-byte
IP header and the 8-byte UDP header. As others have mentioned, additional
protocol headers could be added in some circumstances. A more conservamid = uuid.uuid4().bytes  # 16 byte random uuid
tive
value of around 300-400 bytes may be preferred instead.

Usually ip headers are only 20 bytes so with UDP header (src, dst) of 8 bytes
the maximum allowed payload is 576 - 28 = 548

Any UDP payload this size or smaller is guaranteed to be deliverable over IP
(though not guaranteed to be delivered). Anything larger is allowed to be
outright dropped by any router for any reason.

Except on an IPv6-only route,
where the maximum payload is 1,212 bytes.

Unix Domain Socket:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/424380/what-values-may-linux-use-for-the-default-unix-socket-buffer-size

Path cannot exceed 108 bytes
The  SO_SNDBUF  socket  option does have an effect for UNIX domain sockets,
but the SO_RCVBUF option does not.
For datagram sockets, the SO_SNDBUF value imposes an upper limit on the size
of outgoing datagrams.
This limit is calculated as the doubled (see socket(7)) option value less 32 bytes used for overhead.

Doubling accounts for the overhead.
SO_SNDBUF
              Sets or gets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes.  The
              kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping
              overhead) when it is set using setsockopt(2), and this
              doubled value is returned by getsockopt(2).  The default
              value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default file
              and the maximum allowed value is set by the
              /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max file.  The minimum (doubled)
              value for this option is 2048.

In python the getsockopt apparently does not return the doubled value but
the undoubled value.

Memo
Memo partitioning into grams.

Default gram is of form  gram = head + sep + body.
Some subclasses might have gram of form gram = head + sep + body + tail.
In that case encoding of body + tail must provide a way to separate body from tail.
Typically tail would be a signature on the fore gram = head + sep + body


Separator sep is b'|' must not be a base64 character.

The head consists of three fields in base64

GramCode Typing/Versions uses a different base64 two char code.
Codes always start with `_` and second char in code starts at `_`
and walks backwards through B64 code table for each gram type-version (tv) code.
Each of total head length including code and total neck length must be a
multiple of 4 characters.  so eacch converts to/from B2 without padding.
Head type-version code governs the neck as well. So to change length in order to change
field lengths or add or remove fields need a new gram (tv) code.

To reiterate, if ever need to change anything ned a new gram tv code. There are
no versions per type.  This is deemed sufficient because anticipate a very
limited set of possible fields ever needed for memogram transport types.

tv 0 is '__'
tv 1 is '_-'
tv 3 is '_9'

Because the gram head and neck are valid mid-pad B64 primitives then can be losslessly
transformed to/from CESR primitives merely by translated the gram tv code to
an  equivalent entry in the  two char cesr primitive code table. When doing so
The neck is always attached and then stripped when not needed.

The CESR codes albeit different are one-to-one. This enables representing headers
as CESR primitives for management but not over the wire. I.e. can transform
Memogram Grams to CESR primitives to tunnel in some CESR stream.

Normally CESR streams are tunneled inside Memoer memograms sent over-the-wire.
In this case, the memogram is the wrapper and each gram uses the gram tv code
defined herein not the equivalent CESR code.
Using  so far reserved and unused '_' code which is reserved as the selector
for theCESR op code table for memogram grams makes it more apparent that a gram
belongs to a memogram and not a CESR stream.
Eventually when CESR op codes eventually become defined, it's not likely to be
confusing since the context of CESR op codes is different that transport
wrappers.

Morover when a MemoGram payload is a tunneled CESR Stream, the memogram parser
will parse and strip the MemoGram gram wrappers to construct the tunneled,
stream so the wrapper is transarent to the CESR stream and the CESR stream
payload is opaque to the memogram wrapper, i.e. no ambiguity.



HeadCode hc = b'__'

MemoIDSize mis = 22
GramNumSize gns = 4
GramCntSize gcs = 4
GramHeadSize phs  = 28
GramHeadNeckSize phns = 28 + 4 = 32


MaxGramBodySize = ()2** 16 -1) - HeadSize
GramBodySize pbs = something <= MaxBodySize
GramSize = GramHeadSize + GramBodySize
GramSize <= 2**16 -1

MaxMemoSize = (2**16-1)**2
MaxGramCount for UDP GramSize of 508 is ceil(MaxMemoSize/508) = 8454403  which is < 2**24-1
not gramsize includes head
MaxGramCount for UXD GramSize of 2**16 -1  is ceil(MaxMemoSize/(2**16-1))= 2**16-1
MinGramSize = MaxMemoSize // (2**24-1) = 255  = 2**8-1
MaxGramSize = (2**16-1)
For any given GramSize  there is a MaxGramCount of 2**24-1 so if fix the GramSize
this limits the effective
mms = min((2**16-1)**2), (GramSize - GramHeadSize) * (2**24-1))
mms = min((2**16-1)**2), (GramBodySize) * (2**24-1))
Note there is an extra 4 characters in first gram for the neck

so ps, pbs, and mms are variables specific to transport
PHS is fixed for the transport type reliable unreliable with header fields as defined
The desired ps for a given transport instance may be smaller than the allowed
maximum to accomodate buffers etc.
Given the fixed gram head size PHS once can calculate the maximum memo size
that includes the header overhead given the contraint of no more than 2**24-1
grams in a given memo.

So for a given transport:
ps == min(ps, 2**16-1)
pbs = ps - PHS

mms = min((2**16-1)**2), pbs * (2**24-1))
So compare memo size to mms and if greater raise error and drop memo
otherwise partition (gram) memo into grams with headers and transmit


Note max memo size is (2**16-1)**2 = 4294836225.
But accounting for the gram header overhead the largest payload max memo size is
max gram size = (2**16-1) == 65535
max gram count = (2**24-1) == 16777215
standard header size hs = 28
neck size ns = 4
bs = maxgramsize - hs = (65535 - hs) = 65507  # max standard gram body size
max theoretical memogram payload size mms is
mms = (bs * maxgramcount) - ns  = 65507 * 16777215 - 4 = 1099025023001
but this is too big so we limit it to 4294836225 but we can have a payload
of 4294836225 when using the maxgramsize for each gram.

CESR groups code count in quadlets (4 chars).
The big group count codes have five digits of 6 bits each or 30 bits to count the
size of the following framed chars.
The max count value is therefore (2**30-1). Cesr group codes count the number
of quadlets (4 chars) in the framed group. The maximum number of bytes in a
CESR big group frame body is therefore:
(2**30-1)*4 = 4294967292.
The group code is not gram of the counted quadlets in the frame body.
The big group codes are 8 chars long. Thus with its group code the total big
frame size is:
(2**30-1)*4 + 8 = 4294967300

The largest value for a 32 bit number is
(2 ** 32 - 1) = 4294967295 which is 5 less than the largest group frame size with code.
4294967300 - 4294967295 = 5
Largest total frame size with group code = 2**32+4 which exceeds the largest
value of a 32 bit number.

Restricting the largest memogram payload to be 2**32-1 should be sufficient.
It is anticipated that other limits such as memory or processing power will
constrain memogram sizes to be much smaller than 2**32-1 much less 2**32+4.
So MaximumMemoSize is 2**32-1 = 4294967295
MaxGramSize with overhead is 2**16-1 = 65535 which is a limit on some datagram
transports for the maximum sized datagram. This is true of UDP although the
UDP MTU size is much smaller than this. It may not longer be true on some
OSes that the maximum datagram size for UXD transports is 65535. On some
OSes it may be bigger. But this seems like a good practical limit nonetheless
as OS buffer sizes are usually in the order of magnitude of 65535.


The maximum group count is (2**30-1) == 1073741823

class Memoer(hioing.Mixin):
    """
    Memoer mixin base class to adds memogram support to a transport class.
    Memoer supports asynchronous memograms. Provides common methods for subclasses.

    A memogram is a higher level construct that sits on top of a datagram.
    A memogram supports the segmentation and desegmentation of memos to
    respect the underlying datagram size, buffer, and fragmentation behavior.

    Layering a reliable transaction protocol on top of a memogram enables reliable
    asynchronous messaging over unreliable datagram transport protocols.

    When the datagram protocol is already reliable, then a memogram enables
    larger memos (messages) than that natively supported by the datagram.

    Usage:
        Do not instantiate directly but use as a mixin with a transport class
        in order to create a new subclass that adds memogram support to the
        transport class. For example MemoerUdp or MemoerUxd

    Each direction of dataflow uses a tiered set of buffers that respect
    the constraints of non-blocking asynchronous IO with datagram transports.

    On the receive side each complete datagram (gram) is put in a gram receive
    deque as a segment of a memo. These deques are indexed by the sender's
    source addr. The grams in the gram recieve deque are then desegmented into a memo
    and placed in the memo deque for consumption by the application or some other
    higher level protocol.

    On the transmit side memos are placed in a deque (double ended queue). Each
    memo is then segmented into grams (datagrams) that respect the size constraints
    of the underlying datagram transport. These grams are placed in the outgoing
    gram deque. Each entry in this deque is a duple of form:
    (gram: bytes, dst: str). Each  duple is pulled off the deque and its
    gram is put in bytearray for transport.

    When using non-blocking IO, asynchronous datagram transport
    protocols may have hidden buffering constraints that result in fragmentation
    of the sent datagram which means the whole datagram is not sent at once via
    a non-blocking send call. This means that the remainer of the datagram must
    be sent later and may take multiple send calls to complete. The datagram
    protocol is responsible for managing the buffering and fragmentation but
    depends on the sender repeated attempts to send the reaminder of the
    full datagram. This is ensured with the final tier with a raw transmit
    buffer that waits until it is empty before attempting to send another
    gram. Because sending to different destinations may fail for different reasons
    such as bad addresses or bad routing each destination gets its own buffer
    so that a bad destination does not block other destinations.

    Memo segmentation/desegmentation information is embedded in the grams.

        All gram head codes start with '_' in base64 text or in base2 binary.
        Given only allowed chars are from the set of base64 then can determine
        if header is in base64 or base2.

        First sextet:  (0b is binary, 0o is octal, 0x is hexadecimal)

        0o27 = 0b010111 means first sextet of '_' in base64
        0o77 = 0b111111 means first sextet of '_' in base2

        Assuming that only '_' is allowed as the first char of a valid gram head,
        in either Base64 or Base2 encoding, a parser can unambiguously determine
        if the gram header encoding is binary Base2 or text Base64 because
        0o27 != 0o77.

        Furthermore, it just so happens that 0o27 is a unique first sextet
        among Base64 ascii chars. So an invalid gram header when in Base64 encoding
        is detectable. However, there is one collision (see below) with invalid
        gram headers in Base2 encoding. So an erroneously constructed gram might
        not be detected merely by looking at the first sextet. Therefore
        unreliable transports must provide some additional mechanism such as a
        hash or signature on the gram.

        All Base2 codes for Base64 chars are unique since the B2 codes are just
        the count from 0 to 63. There is one collision, however, between Base2 and
        Base 64 for invalid gram headers. This is because 0o27 is the
        base2 code for ascii 'V'. This means that Base2 encodings
        that begin 0o27 witch is the Base2 encoding of the ascii 'V, would be
        incorrectly detected as text not binary.

           echoic (bool): True means echo sends into receives via. echos
                           False measn do not echo

        Each entry in.txgs is duple of form: (gram: bytes, dst: str)
        where:
            gram (bytes): is outgoing gram segment from associated memo
            dst (str): is far peer destination address

        .txbs is duple of form: (gram: bytearray, dst: str)
        where:
            gram (bytearray): holds incompletly sent gram portion if any
            dst (str | None): destination or None if last completely sent

        Returns:
            result (bool):  True means greedy callers can keep sending since
                                last gram sent completely.
                            False means either last gram send was incomplete and
                                or there are no more grams in .txgs deque. In
                                either case greedy callers need to wait and
                                try again later.

        The return value True or False enables back pressure on greedy callers
        so they know when to block waiting.

        When there is a remainder in .txbs each subsequent call of this method
        will attempt to send the remainder until the the full gram has been sent.
        This accounts for datagram protocols that expect continuing attempts to
        send remainder of a datagram when using nonblocking sends.

        When the far side peer is unavailable the gram is dropped. This means
        that unreliable transports need to have a timeour retry mechanism.

        Internally, a dst of None in the .txbs duple indicates its ok to take
        another gram from the .txgs deque if any and start sending it.
