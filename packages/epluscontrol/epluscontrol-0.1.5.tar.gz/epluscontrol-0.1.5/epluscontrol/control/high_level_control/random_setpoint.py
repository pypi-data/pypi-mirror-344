    This controller is useful for testing system responses or for generating
    excitation signals for system identification.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    time_step (int, optional): 
        Time step between control updates in minutes. 
        Defaults to 60.
    sensor_name (str):
        Name of the sensor used to measure the controlled variable
    min_setpoint (float, optional):
        Minimum temperature setpoint in °C. 
        Default is 19.
    max_setpoint (float, optional):
        Maximum temperature setpoint in °C. 
        Default is 21.
    random_seed (int, optional):
        Seed for the random number generator. 
        Default is 42.
    change_probability (float, optional):
        Probability of changing the setpoint at each time step (0.0-1.0). 
        Default is 0.25.
