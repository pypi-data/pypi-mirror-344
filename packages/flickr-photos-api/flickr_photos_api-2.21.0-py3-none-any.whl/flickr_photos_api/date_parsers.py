    The Flickr API frequently returns dates as Unix timestamps, for example:

    *   When you call ``flickr.photos.getInfo``, the ``<dates>`` element
        includes the upload and last update dates as a timestamp
    *   When you call ``flickr.people.getInfo`` for a user with Flickr Pro,
        the ``expires`` attribute is a numeric timestamp.

    In this case a Unix timestamp is "an unsigned integer specifying
    the number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970 GMT" [1].
