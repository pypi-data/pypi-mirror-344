# tools-jsyoo61

(DEPRECATED 2025.04.28. Migrated to `tools` package (pip install tools))

My personal tools for python programming.\

    pip install tools-jsyoo61

    import tools as T
    T.save_pickle(data, 'data.p')
    data = T.load_pickle('data.p')

Most useful functions are in `tools.tools`\
API dependent tools are in their corresponding folders: `tools.API_name` (i.e. `tools.torch.optim`)
Not documented yet, so you'll have to look at documents written inside the codes. (Most codes contain explanation)

`scripts/` folder is not included in pip. It's just a copy-paste format

I'm open to using my tools for any purpose, and I would appreciate it if the users let me know.
Please email me before using it.

If you have any questions or suggestions, I am more than happy to discuss them :smile: \
Please contact me via email or pull request. (I prefer email though)
