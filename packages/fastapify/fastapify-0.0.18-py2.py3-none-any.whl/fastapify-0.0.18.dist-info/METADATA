## Usage

### Create a New Project

To create a new FastAPI project, run:

```bash
fastapify startproject my-fastapi-project
```

This will scaffold a directory structure with the following layout:

```
my-fastapi-project/
├── .envs/
│   ├── .local/
│   │      ├── .db
│   │      └── .web
│   └── .prod/
│   
├── compose/
│   ├── local/
│   │      └── django/
│   │            └── Dockerfile
│   └── prod/
│          └── django/ 
├── core
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── database.py
│   └── middlewares.py
│  
├── requirements/
│   ├── base.txt
│   └── local.txt
│  
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── api.py
│
├── local.yml
├── prod.yml
└── README.md
```

### Create new App

Easily add new applications to your project with:

```bash
fastapify startapp myapp
```

This creates `src/myapp/` with the following structure:

app structure:

```
myapp/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── models.py
├── router.py
├── schemas.py
└── service.py
```
