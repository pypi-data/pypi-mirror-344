**A secure multi-agent framework by TBH.AI focused on high security.**

This package provides tools and structures for building multi-agent systems with a strong emphasis on security principles. Developed by Saish at TBH.AI.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **High Security Focus:** Built with security best practices from the ground up. (Details TBD)
*   **Modular Agent Design:** Easily define and customize agents.
*   **Flexible Task Management:** Define complex workflows and tasks for agents.
*   **Secure Communication:** Mechanisms for secure inter-agent communication. (Details TBD)
*   **(Other differentiating features...)**

## Installation

```bash
pip install tbh-secure-agents
```

## Documentation

Full documentation, including installation instructions, usage guides, and details on the security focus, can be found in the `docs/` directory:

*   **[Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md)**
*   **[Usage Guide](./docs/usage_guide.md)**
*   **[Security Focus](./docs/security_focus.md)**

## Getting Started (Quick Example)

Here's a conceptual example:

```python
# Example Usage (Conceptual) - See docs/usage_guide.md for details
# from tbh_secure_agents import Expert, Operation, Squad

# Define experts with specific specialties and security contexts
# security_researcher = Expert(specialty='Security Researcher', objective='Identify vulnerabilities', security_profile='high')
# reporting_expert = Expert(specialty='Reporter', objective='Summarize findings securely', security_profile='medium')

# Define operations
# research_operation = Operation(instructions='Analyze system X for security flaws', expert=security_researcher)
# reporting_operation = Operation(instructions='Compile a secure report of findings', expert=reporting_expert)

# Form a squad
# security_squad = Squad(
#     experts=[security_researcher, reporting_expert],
#     operations=[research_operation, reporting_operation],
#     verbose=True # Or configure security logging
# )

# Deploy the squad
# result = security_squad.deploy()

# print(result) # Securely handled output
```
