# Health MCP Server

This project provides an MCP server for accessing Azure Cloud Health information using custom health tools.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Azure credentials set up for `DefaultAzureCredential` (e.g., via `az login` or environment variables)
- The following Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `azure-identity`
  - `mcp` (ensure this is installed or available in your environment)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```pwsh
   pip install requests azure-identity
   ```

   If `mcp` is not available on PyPI, ensure it is installed or accessible in your environment.

## Running the MCP Server

From the root directory, run:

```pwsh
python src/HealthToolsMcpServer.py
```

The server will start and register the health tools.

## Usage

The server exposes two main tools:

- **GetEntityHealthPy**: Get the health of an entity.
- **GetHealthModelPy**: Get the health model.

Refer to the code in `src/HealthToolsMcpServer.py` for details on tool parameters.

## Logging

Logs are written to `c:\temp\McpServerPy.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Azure credentials are correctly configured.
- Check the log file for error details if something goes wrong.
