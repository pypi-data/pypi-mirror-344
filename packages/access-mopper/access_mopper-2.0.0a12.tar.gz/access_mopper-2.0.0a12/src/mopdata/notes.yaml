# File to use to add optional notes attribute for specific variables
# or calculations, or potentilly other fields passed by ctx.obj in mopper.py
# Code will check if any of the keys listed in variable_id and calculation
# are matching the ones listed for a specific file and if yes will add that
# information to the notes attribute.
#
# NB for calculation we don't want a perfect match so we use '~' at
# start of key to indicate this.
# Potentially we might need to be more specific in future for variable notes
# as they might differ depending on versions etc.

    calculation:
       ~plevinterp: "Linearly interpolated from model levels using numpy.interp() function. NaNs are assigned to pressure levels falling out of the height range covered by the model"
