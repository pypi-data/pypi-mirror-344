    A utility function to query all layers of an objectclass.

    Example
    -------

    >>> feature_set = query_objectclass_layers(objectclass)
    >>> print(feature_set)

    Outputs the following structure:

        {
        count: int                          // The count of returned features
        objectIdFieldName: str              // The name of the objectclass id field

        features: EmsFeature[]              // The features
        name: str                           // Name of the objectclass.
        spatialReference: SpatialReferece   // The srs of the objectclass.

    Args:
        objectclass: EmsObjectclass: the objectclass instance to query.
        where: a SQL-like string
        geometry: a boolean to indicate to return also the geometry
        variants: a list of variant IDs to query
        **kwargs: additional a keyworded, variable-length argument list, please refer
            to ems documentation
