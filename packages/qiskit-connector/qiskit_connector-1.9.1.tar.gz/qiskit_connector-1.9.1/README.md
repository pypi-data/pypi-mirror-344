**‚öõÔ∏èIBM Quantum Qiskit Connector For Backend RuntimeService**

A Quantum helper package which streamlines authentication, plan detection, and backend selection for Qiskit RuntimeService. This connector prevents repeated writing of runtimeservice instead allows you to directly use the `backend` object all over your quantum application code in realtime. This package performs the following:
- Loads environment variables from config file (e.g. `.env`) to configure your IBM Quantum account plan and make the `backend` object available within your quantum application code for reuse in real-time.
- Detects your active plan (Open, Standard, Premium, Dedicated) and sets up the correct channel/instance.
- It has functions to save your account using its (`qiskit_smart`), to verify QPU resources using (`qpu_verify`, `is_verified`), and retrieve a ready-to-use backend using (`connector()`). Presents you with the least-busy backend to run your quantum application code in realtime instead of you using simulators.

## üìã Features & API

All of the following functions are available after you import the module:

```python
from qiskit_connector import (
    connector,
    plan_type
)
```

- **`qiskit_smart(plan_type: str)`**  
  Saves your IBM Quantum account into QiskitRuntimeService using the environment variables for the given plan (`"open"`, `"standard"`, `"premium"`, or `"dedicated"`).

- **`qpu_verify()`**  
  Lists available QPUs for your plan by querying `QiskitRuntimeService.backends()` or falling back to `paid_plans()` for paid plans.

- **`is_verified()`**  
  Verifies real‚Äêtime least-busy QPU for the active plan and prints details (name, qubit count, online date).

- **`connector() -> IBMBackend`**  
  **Main entry point**: Loads your saved account, picks the least busy QPU (or first available for open or paid plans), prints diagnostics, and returns an `IBMBackend` instance ready for circuit execution.

- **`plan_type() -> str`**  
  Returns either **"Open Plan"** or **"Paid Plan"** depending on your `.env` toggles.

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install qiskit-connector
```

This will also pull in functionalities powered by:
- `qiskit>=2.0.0`  
  

and any other Qiskit dependencies. (Qiskit 1.x is not supported).

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Environment Variable Setup
üîê Security Practice: Do not check-in `.env` or any environment variable files into version control. Add it to your .gitignore. During development, create a file named `.env` at your project root. The connector will automatically load it.Use the template below as the content of your .env file or variable config file.

```dotenv

## üìñ Usage

### Open Plan (default free tier) and Paid Plan

```python

from qiskit_connector import connector, plan_type
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler, Session

# QPU execution mode by plan: Use of 'backend' object.
current = plan_type()
backend = connector()

if current == "Open Plan":  # session not supported
    sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
    print("Your Plan",current)
    print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
    if isinstance(backend, IBMBackend):
        print("This is a real & live QPU device")
    else:
        print("This is a simulator")
    print(f"\n")
elif current == "Paid Plan":  # supports session
    with Session(backend=backend.name) as session:
        sampler = Sampler(mode=session)
        print("Your Plan",current)
        print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
        if isinstance(backend, IBMBackend):
            print("This is a real & live QPU device")
        else:
            print("This is a simulator")
        print(f"\n")
else:
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown plan type: {current}")

# --- do other things below with backend, quantum circuit, sampler & transpilation ------
```
