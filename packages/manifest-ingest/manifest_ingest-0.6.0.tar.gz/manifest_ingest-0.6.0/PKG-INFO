# Manifest Ingest
Author: Tim Santor <tsantor@xstudios.com>

# Overview
Download a project JSON manifest and its media files via S3, SFTP or HTTP. This tool was developed for internal use on all X Studios interactive installations which need to have the ability to run "offline" when there is no active network connection.

# Installation
```
pip install manifest-ingest
```

> Note: On Windows Visual Studio C++ Build Tools 14 is required. You can install it with Chocolatey via: `choco install microsoft-visual-cpp-build-tools`

# Usage

## Create a Config file
Create a config file at `~/manifest-ingest.cfg`:

```ini
[default]
; API endpoint which returns JSON
api_url = http://192.168.1.69:8000/api/v1/music/playlist/
; Authorization header needed to access the API (optional)
api_token = Token API_TOKEN
; Regex of key names to search for
keys = (audio_url|artwork_url)
; Override the default manifest filename (optional)
manifest_filename = manifest.json
; Local directory to place downloaded files
local_dir = ~/target/dir/downloads
; Where to place the log file for the application
log = ~/target/dir/manifest-ingest.log
; Max retries to make failed network request before giving up
max_retries = 5
; Base URL for relative paths
base_url = http://192.168.1.69:8000
; Concurrent downloads (number of cores * 2 is usually best)
concurrent_downloads = 4

[s3]
profile_name = default
bucket_name = BUCKET_NAME
; Compare MD5 hash of local file with remote file
compare_md5 = true

[sftp]
server = 192.168.1.100
username = USERNAME
password = PASSWORD
; Remote directory on server to prepend to file URLs in manifest
remote_dir = /path/to/project

[post_download]
; Command to run when complete
command = osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate'
```

> NOTE: The config file can be located anywhere that is readable by the user. The `s3`, `sftp` and `post_download` sections are optional.

## Usage

```bash
manifest-ingest --config=~/manifest-ingest.cfg
```

## Run at Startup (Mac)
Create a plist file as `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.manifestingest.plist`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.user.manifestingest</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/manifest-ingest</string>
        <string>--config</string>
        <string>~/config/manifest-ingest.cfg</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then run:

```bash
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.manifestingest.plist
```

## Run at Startup (PC)
Create a Scheduled Task.

- **Triggers** - At log on of any user (Delay task for 30 secs)
- **Actions** - Start a Program: manifest-ingest --config="/Users/Admin/project/config/manifest-ingest.cfg"

On Windows, your bat file to launch a Unity app will look something like this:

```
START "" /D "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\AppName" "AppName.exe" -screen-fullscreen 1 -screen-width 1920 -screen-height 1080
```

## Undated updates

- **0.4.5** - Added Python 3.6+ support (still works with Python 2.7+)
- **0.4.4** - It's a mystery...
- **0.4.3** - Added multiprocessing to speed up downloads
- **0.4.2**
  - **Changed** Changed the way we look for keys with URLs (absolute or relative) to regex.
  - **Changed** Changed the way we strip URL prefixes to make paths relative (to to the download directory) to regex.
  - **Added** Added ability to specify AWS credenttial profile to use for S3 in config.
- **0.4.1** - Added ability to compare local and remote MD5 hashes to determine if a file is newer on S3.
- **0.4.0** - Complete refactor. Single entrypoint of `manifest-ingest`. Via config can handle S3, SFTP and HTTP manifest URL downloads.
- **0.3.6** - Update the way we save the manifest with s3 manifests.
- **0.3.5** - Added `manifest-s3` to handle manifests of S3 files.
- **0.3.4** - Lock in version of pysftp to 0.2.8 due to 0.2.9 HostKeys issue...again.
- **0.3.3** - Added `manifest_filename` config so we can save to custom named manifest file.
- **0.3.2** - After a failed SSH attempt, revert manifest to original and run post_download.
- **0.3.1** - Bug fix with creating remote path correctly on Windows.
- **0.3.0** - Revert to original manifest on SFTP login failure as we won't be able to download the files in the manifest.
- **0.2.9** - Lock in version of pysftp to 0.2.8 due to 0.2.9 HostKeys issue.
- **0.2.8** - Improved connection and SSH exception handling and added connection retries up to a max number of times.
- **0.2.7** - Due to complications with running via command line, we removed the Keychain/Credential Manager support. You may now pass passwords via Base64 to at least thwart over the shoulder attacks. Also changed the way we execute the post download command to be non-blocking.
- **0.2.6** - When executing `manifest-sftp` over SSH, Keychain/Credential Manager do not provide the password so we added the ability to manually provide a password via the `-p` or `--password` argument on the command line (use with caution)
- **0.2.5** - Use Keychain (OSX) or Credential Manager (Windows) to get SFTP password
- **0.2.4** - If manifest is empty (eg - {}), then we abort and do not launch post_download commands
- **0.2.3** - Removed some logging clutter
- **0.2.2** - Additional logging
- **0.2.1** - Fixed bug where local filename would be striped of the word "media"
- **0.2.0** - Key names are now a regex which is more flexible & powerful
- **0.1.3** - Added elapsed time to log
- **0.1.2** - Fixed remote path bug on Windows
- **0.1.1** - Fixed url path removal from JSON and correct os paths
- **0.1.0** - Fixed bug with run_command call typo
- **0.0.9** - Fixed bug with config setup importing from wrong package
- **0.0.8** - Fixed bug where we expected a api_token in the config (not always needed)
- **0.0.7** - Added single package entry point (all script entry points us same config) and Removed `manifest-quickstart`
