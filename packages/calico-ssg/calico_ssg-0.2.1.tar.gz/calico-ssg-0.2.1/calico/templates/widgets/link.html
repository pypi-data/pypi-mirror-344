{% docstring %}
  Markdown links are always opened in a new tab.

  If you'd like to have links that open in the current tab (ie: for internal links), use this widget
  inline within your markdown

  `<cc‐link with text="my text" link="/link/to/page.html" />`

  Attributes:
    text: link text
    link: link url
{% enddocstring %}
<a href="{{link}}">{{text}}</a>
