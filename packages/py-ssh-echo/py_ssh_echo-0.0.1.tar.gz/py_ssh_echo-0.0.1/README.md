# py-ssh-echo

A simple **AsyncSSH-based echo SSH server** designed for testing purposes. This server provides an interactive shell and will echo any input sent over SSH, and logs basic session information (e.g., username, IP, bytes received, session duration) to stdout.

---

## Features

- **Echoes input**: Whatever you send to the server is echoed back, line by linepy.
- **Tracks session metadata**: Collects details like username, IP address, bytes received, and session duration.
- **Easy to use**: Can be run as a standalone server or imported as a module in other Python projects.
- **Customizable**: Choose the port for the server, and track session details through a callback function.

## Installation

You can install this package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ssh-echo-server
```

Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ssh-echo-server.git
cd ssh-echo-server
pip install .
```

---

## Usage

### As a standalone server

Run the server from the command line:

```bash
python -m ssh_echo_server.server
```

By default, the server will run on **localhost:2222**. You can specify a custom port by passing it as an argument:

```bash
python -m ssh_echo_server.server 2022
```

### As an imported module

You can also import and run the server from your Python scripts:

```python
from ssh_echo_server import start_echo_server

async def main():
    # Optionally, define a callback to track session data
    def track_session(info):
        print(f"Session ended: {info}")

    # Start the echo server on a custom port
    server = await start_echo_server(port=2022, session_tracker=track_session)

    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Keep the server running for 60 seconds
    finally:
        # Gracefully shut down the server
        server.close()
        await server.wait_closed()

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```
