# CRLite Implementation in Python

This capstone project aims to bring CRLite support to Python by using the Clubcard filter files from Mozilla and the `crlite-clubcard` Rust library (https://github.com/mozilla/clubcard-crlite).

It uses PyO3 bindings to call methods from `crlite-clubcard`.

This project is published as a Python package in PyPI at- (https://pypi.org/project/crlite-python/).
