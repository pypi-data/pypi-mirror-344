# principal_portfolios

A Python package implementing the **Principal Portfolios** methodology introduced by Kelly, Malamud, and Pedersen (2023), *The Journal of Finance*.

## 📘 Overview

This package provides tools for constructing and analyzing **Principal Portfolios**—linear trading strategies derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the **prediction matrix** that captures both own-asset and cross-asset predictive signals.

Key components include:

- Construction of the prediction matrix from asset returns and signals
- Decomposition into:
  - **Principal Portfolios (PPs)**: timeable portfolios ordered by predictability
  - **Principal Exposure Portfolios (PEPs)**: factor-exposed strategies (beta)
  - **Principal Alpha Portfolios (PAPs)**: factor-neutral strategies (alpha)
