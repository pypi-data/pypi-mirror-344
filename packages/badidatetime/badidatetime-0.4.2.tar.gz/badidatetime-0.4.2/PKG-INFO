The objective of this API (Application Programming Interface) is to implement
a library that provides date and time functionality similar to that of the
standard Python datetime package, however for the Badí' Calendar this API is
much more extensive than the standard package as it includes all the
astronomical calculations needed to find the Vernal Equinox, sunset, and many
other astronomical events that are needed to support the Badí' Calendar.

The Badí' Calendar is an Astronomical Self-correcting Solar Calendar. Since
astronomical calculations are needed it is obviously an astronomical calendar.
It is self-correcting because the leap years are determined by calculating the
number of days from the sunset immediately preceding the Vernal Equinox to the
sunset immediately preceding the next Vernal Equinox. Counting the days it will
either be 365 on ordinary years or 366 on leap years. The Vernal Equinox is
when the sun is directly above the equator and the length of the day and night
are nearly equal making it a solar calendar.

The Badí' leap years are irregular and cannot be guess with a simple formula as
is done with Gregorian Calendar. Quite in contrast the Gregorian Calendar is
only a solar calendar. It uses a guesstimating formula to approximate when the
leap years will be. This formula I call a 4/100/400 formula. In other words a
leap year is every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 then it is not a
leap year unless it is also dividable by 400 then it is a leap year. This means
that the Gregorian leap years are on a 400 year cycle and can be more-or-less
predicted by the above formula thus making leap years fairly regular.
