## Project Overview

This project implements RockTalk, a ChatGPT-like chatbot webapp using Streamlit for the frontend, LangChain for the logic, and Amazon Bedrock as the backend. The webapp provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with various Language Models (LLMs) with advanced features for customization and data input.

## Key Features

- 💬 Real-time chat with streaming responses and interactive controls
- 🔍 Powerful search across chat history and session metadata
- 📝 Customizable templates for different use cases
- 🖼️ Support for text and image inputs
- 📚 Complete session management with import/export
- ⏳ Temporary sessions for quick, unsaved interactions
- ⚙️ Fine-grained control over LLM parameters
- 🧠 Extended thinking support for Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python >=3.11 (only 3.11 tested, but >3.11 expected to work as well)
- AWS Account with Bedrock model access
- Supported models: Claude, Titan, etc.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. Install RockTalk using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install rocktalk
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   - RockTalk uses AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Configure credentials via:
     - AWS CLI configuration
     - Environment variables
     - For more details, see: <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>

3. Configure Bedrock Foundation Model access:
   - Enable [Model Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) in AWS console
   - Default model: `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`
   - Override default by setting `ROCKTALK_DEFAULT_MODEL` environment variable

4. Start RockTalk:

   ```sh
   rocktalk
   ```

5. Access the webapp at <http://localhost:8501>

- **Apply template**: Select template when creating new chat.
- **Modify templates**: Edit existing templates in template manager.
- **Share templates**: Export/Import template configurations.

### Search Features

- Full-text search across all chats.
- Filter by date range.

- Advanced search with multiple criteria.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- ⌘/⊞ + ⌫ : Stop streaming response.
- Enter : Send message.
- ⌘/⊞ + Enter : Add new line.

## Advanced Features

### Extended Thinking with Claude 3.7

RockTalk supports Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking capability, allowing you to see the model's step-by-step reasoning process:

- **How it works**: Claude shows its internal reasoning before providing a final response, making its problem-solving process transparent and verifiable.

- **Setup**:
  1. Select a Claude 3.7 Sonnet model in session settings
  2. Enable "Extended Thinking"
  3. Set your thinking budget (1,024-128,000 tokens)

- **Benefits**:
  - See step-by-step problem-solving logic
  - Improved responses for complex tasks
  - Verify reasoning and catch potential errors

- **Important Notes**:
  - Temperature, top_p, and top_k settings are disabled when using extended thinking
  - Thinking tokens are billed as output tokens
  - Larger thinking budgets may improve response quality but increase costs

### Usage Guidelines and Limits

Consider these factors when using extended thinking:

- **Costs and Token Usage**:
  - Thinking tokens count as output tokens for billing
  - Each response with extended thinking uses significantly more tokens
  - Monitor usage in session settings panel

- **Recommended Token Budgets**:
  
  | Task Complexity | Token Budget   | Examples                          |
  |----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Simple         | 1,024-4,000   | Basic questions, clarifications   |
  | Moderate       | 4,000-16,000  | Analysis, problem-solving         |
  | Complex        | 16,000-32,000 | Research, multi-step reasoning    |

- **Rate Limits and Performance**:
  - Default rate limit: 800,000 tokens per minute
  - Extended thinking responses take longer to generate
  - Use streaming mode to see reasoning in real-time
  - Rate limits can be configured in settings

- **Optimization**:
  - Previous thinking blocks don't count toward context window
  - Token budget is "up to" - model may use less if appropriate
  - Monitor token usage in session settings to optimize costs

## Troubleshooting

- AWS credentials setup.
- Common error messages.
- Performance tips.
- **Logging:**
  - Set `ROCKTALK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for detailed logging.
  - Logs are stored in `~/.rocktalk/logs/rocktalk.log`.
  - View logs in the application settings panel.

## Advanced Setup

### File Locations

RockTalk stores its data in the following locations:

- Main configuration directory: `~/.rocktalk/`
- Database file: `~/.rocktalk/chat_database.db`
- Log files: `~/.rocktalk/logs/`
- Environment file (optional): `~/.rocktalk/.env`

### Environment Variables

RockTalk can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `ROCKTALK_DIR`: Main configuration directory (default: `~/.rocktalk/`)
- `ROCKTALK_DEFAULT_MODEL`: Override default Bedrock model
- `ROCKTALK_LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (default: "INFO")
  - Available levels: "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
  - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
  - INFO: General operational information
  - WARNING: Warning messages for potential issues
  - ERROR: Error messages for serious problems
  - CRITICAL: Critical errors that may prevent operation

## Development Details

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Amazon Bedrock
- Logic/Integration: LangChain
- Storage: SQLite

### Storage

The storage interface is designed to be extensible for future additional storage options. The storage engine interface:

- Stores all chat sessions, messages, and templates.
- Supports full-text search and complex queries.

By default:

- Chat database is stored in `chat_database.db` in the project root directory `~/.rocktalk`. This file is auto-generated with preset templates and necessary tables to meet the interface requirements. The database file can be deleted at any time and it will be regenerated.
- The database contents can be modified manually using any SQLite editing tool (e.g., SQLite3 Editor extension in VS Code). This can be useful for debugging application issues or just to see how your data is stored.
- **Security Note**: While default database file permissions restrict access to just the current user (read/write only), the database file itself is not encrypted. Exercise caution with sensitive information as the contents remain readable if the file is accessed.

### Chat Templates

RockTalk implements a flexible template system that allows users to save and reuse chat configurations. Templates include:

- **Configuration Persistence**: Save complete LLM configurations including model parameters, system prompts, and other settings.
- **Template Management**:
  - Create templates from successful chat sessions.
  - Save frequently used configurations.
  - Import/Export templates for sharing.
  - Duplicate and modify existing templates.
- **Easy Application**:
  - Apply templates to new sessions.
  - Quick-start conversations with predefined settings.
  - Consistent experience across multiple chats.
- **Template Metadata**:
  - Custom names and descriptions.
  - Unique template IDs for tracking.
  - Configuration versioning.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Specialized chat personas.
  - Task-specific configurations.
  - Team-wide standardized settings.
  - Experimental configurations.
  - Extended thinking templates for complex reasoning tasks.
