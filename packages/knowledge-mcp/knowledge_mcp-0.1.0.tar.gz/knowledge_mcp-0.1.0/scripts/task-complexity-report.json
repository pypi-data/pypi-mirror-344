      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup and configuration management task into subtasks covering project directory structure creation, dependency and environment setup, pyproject.toml configuration, YAML parsing with environment variable substitution, and config.py implementation for all PRD-specified sections.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple foundational activities: structuring the project, managing dependencies, and implementing robust configuration parsing with environment variable support. Each step requires careful attention to best practices and error handling, but the logic is straightforward and well-documented in industry standards."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Knowledge Base Management Core Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the knowledge base management core implementation into subtasks for kb_manager.py module creation, directory structure initialization, safe creation/deletion logic with validation, and error handling for edge cases.",
      "reasoning": "The core logic is clear—directory operations and validation—but must be robust to prevent data loss or corruption. The complexity is moderate due to the need for safe file operations and validation logic."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Document Processing and LightRAG Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down document processing and LightRAG integration into subtasks for multi-format document parsing, text extraction, LightRAG chunking, embedding generation, storage of processed data, and configuration-driven model selection.",
      "reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need to support multiple document formats, integrate with an external library (LightRAG), and ensure correct embedding and storage. Handling different file types and external dependencies increases implementation and testing challenges."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Document Management Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand document management implementation into subtasks for extending kb_manager.py, integrating document processor, validation for duplicates and existence, embedding management, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Adding and removing documents involves coordination with the document processor, embedding management, and validation logic. Ensuring data integrity and handling edge cases adds to the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Search Functionality Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down search functionality implementation into subtasks for search.py module creation, LightRAG in-context integration, query embedding generation, result formatting, and configuration-driven model usage.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing search requires integrating with LightRAG, managing embeddings, and ensuring efficient and accurate result formatting. The complexity is elevated by the need for performance and correctness in search operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "CLI Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide CLI implementation into subtasks for command-line argument parsing, command mapping to core functions, argument validation, and error/exit code handling.",
      "reasoning": "While CLI development is well-supported by libraries, mapping commands to core logic and ensuring robust validation and error handling requires careful design, but the patterns are standard."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "MCP Server Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down MCP server implementation into subtasks for FastMCP server setup, search method exposure, configuration integration, CLI command integration, and protocol compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Exposing search functionality over a protocol-compliant server involves network programming, configuration management, and ensuring compatibility with clients, which increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Error Handling and Logging Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand error handling and logging implementation into subtasks for exception class design, error message standardization, logging system integration, log level and output configuration, CLI exit code management, and application-wide error coverage.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling and logging require consistent patterns across the codebase, integration with configuration, and ensuring all failure scenarios are covered, which is challenging and critical for maintainability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Utility Functions and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down utility and optimization work into subtasks for utility function implementation, vector storage optimization, retrieval performance tuning, caching strategy design, and memory management for large knowledge bases.",
      "reasoning": "Optimizing for large-scale data and implementing reusable utilities requires careful design and testing. Performance tuning and memory management add significant complexity, especially for scalability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Documentation and Examples",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide documentation and examples into subtasks for installation instructions, usage and configuration documentation, example scenario creation, and troubleshooting guide development.",
      "reasoning": "Documentation is essential but less technically complex than implementation tasks. The main challenge is ensuring clarity, completeness, and accessibility for users and developers."
