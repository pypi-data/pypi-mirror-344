# Numeripy

Numeripy is a numerical methods package that includes various numerical methods often encountered in senior year Numerical Analysis + Optimization courses. It is written with the motivation to provide flexibility to the user in selecting a certain scheme and having a good precision control. It also helps one compare and contrast the performances of different schemes for a certain problem. Another potential avenue of use would be for pedagogical purposes - with a pre-compiled library, real time analysis of rather involved methods in class is made possible

## Getting numeripy
(Assuming, the user already has pip installed - otherwise, follow [this][dsf] first to get pip)

Getting numeripy is as simple as opening command prompt and entering
```
$ pip install numeripy
```

## Working with numeripy
#### Dependencies
`numeripy` requires
 - ``numpy``
 - ``matplotlib``
 - ``tabulate``

 to be able to function properly

#### numeripy.help()
``numeripy.help()`` takes a keyword argument about any of the above methods and prints the subdirectory that needs to be imported along with information pertaining to function input and output. `.help()` can also be accessed from any of the subdirectory (that is to say, `numeripy.help()` provides information about all functionality inside `numeripy`, whereas, `numeripy.matrix_methods.help()` provides information only about the matrix methods.)

## What to expect in numeripy 0.2
#### Optimization schemes
`numeripy` plans to include a subdirectory containing standard optimization algorithms such as Gradient descent, Gradient descent for higher order multidimensional problems, Secant method, Line search, Newton's method and a few others.

#### Example problem set
`numeripy` also plans to include a folder with many example problems that the user is invited to try out. The Examples folder will be located along with the user's `numeripy` installation. (This update will be released shortly).
