Security Audit Module

This module provides security auditing capabilities for the quantum-AI platform,
ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of quantum computations
and classical data processing.

Key features:
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols validation
- Security log analysis and anomaly detection
- Compliance checking for quantum data handling
- Pen-testing tools for quantum-classical hybrid systems
- Access control verification for quantum resources

The module is designed to integrate with the platform's logging system
and provides both automated and manual security assessment tools.
