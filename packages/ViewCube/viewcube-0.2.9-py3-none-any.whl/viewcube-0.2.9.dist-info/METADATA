# ViewCube - Datacube Visualization [& Sonification] Tool

**ViewCube** is a user-friendly datacube visualizer designed to streamline the exploration and 
analysis of multi-dimensional datasets. It enables easy visualization and interaction with 
datacubes, while its **Sonicube** interface offers auditory exploration through **sonification**, 
enriching the data analysis process.

Additionally, the tool allows for the exploration of raw-stacked spectra (RSS) via its **ViewRSS** 
interface, provided a fiber position table is available.

## Usage

To visualize a datacube, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the folder where your datacube file (`name_cube.fits`) is located.
3. Enter the following command:
    ```
    ViewCube name_cube.fits
    ```

The first time you run ``ViewCube`` you may need to create a configuration file:
```
ViewCube --config-file
```


## Cheat Sheet

Refer to the ``ViewCube.pdf`` cheat sheet PDF file in the GitHub latex directory or 
the [documentation](https://viewcube.readthedocs.io/) for a list of keyboard 
shortcuts and quick operations to enhance your experience.

Start exploring your datacubes with ViewCube and gain valuable insights effortlessly. For any further assistance or feedback, please refer to the documentation or reach out to our support team. Happy visualizing!
