# MANIFEST.in file for the stringfun package
#
# This file specifies which non-Python files should be included in your package distribution.
# When you set include_package_data=True in setup.py, setuptools uses this file to determine
# which files to include.
#
# For beginners and students:
# - This file uses glob patterns to specify files to include or exclude
# - Common patterns include:
#   - include: Include specific files
#   - exclude: Exclude specific files
#   - recursive-include: Include all files in a directory matching a pattern
#   - recursive-exclude: Exclude all files in a directory matching a pattern
#   - global-include: Include all files matching a pattern anywhere in the source tree
#   - global-exclude: Exclude all files matching a pattern anywhere in the source tree
