StripePy is a CLI application written in Python that recognizes architectural stripes found in the interaction matrix files
generated by Chromosome Conformation Capture experiments, such as Hi-C and Micro-C.
Matrix files in `.cool`, `.mcool`, and `.hic` (including `.hic` v9 files) are supported.

StripePy is developed on Linux and macOS and is also tested on Windows.

## Installing StripePy

### Installing with pip

```bash
pip install 'stripepy-hic[all]'
```

### Installing with conda

```bash
conda create -n stripepy -c conda-forge -c bioconda stripepy-hic
```

### Installing from source

Instructions for Linux and macOS:

```bash
# create and activate a venv (optional)
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

# get StripePy source code
git clone https://github.com/paulsengroup/StripePy.git

# optional, checkout a specific version
# git checkout v0.0.2

# install StripePy
cd StripePy
pip install '.[all]'

# ensure StripePy is in your PATH
stripepy --help
```

<details>
<summary>Instructions for Windows</summary>

```bash
# create and activate a venv (optional)
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# get StripePy source code
git clone https://github.com/paulsengroup/StripePy.git

# optional, checkout a specific version
# git checkout v0.0.2

# install StripePy
cd StripePy
pip install .

# ensure StripePy is in your PATH
stripepy --help
```

</details>

## Running StripePy

StripePy is organized into a few subcommands:

- `stripepy call`: run the stripe detection algorithm and store the identified stripes in a `.hdf5` file.
- `stripepy view`: take the `result.hdf5` file generated by `stripepy call` and extract stripes in BEDPE format.
- `stripepy plot`: generate various kinds of plots to inspect the stripes identified by `stripepy call`.
- `stripepy download`: download a minified sample dataset suitable to quickly test StripePy.

### Walkthrough

The following is an example of a typical run of StripePy.
The steps outlined in this section assume that StripePy is running on a UNIX system.
Some commands may need a bit of tweaking to run on Windows.

#### 1) Download a sample dataset (optional)

Feel free to use your own interaction matrix instead of `4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool`.

Please make sure the matrix is in `.cool`, `.mcool`, or `.hic` format.

```console
# This may take a while on slow internet connections
user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy download --name 4DNFI9GMP2J8

```

#### 2) Detect architectural stripes

This is the core of the analysis and may take several minutes when processing large files.

Running the above command produces a single output file named `4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5`.

The path to the output file can be changed by using the `--output-file` CLI option.

Furthermore, it is possible to save the complete log of a run to a file by specifying the path where to store the log file through the `--log-file` CLI option.

Finally, `stripepy call` can generate several diagnostic plots that can be of help to gain more insights into the decisions made by the tool.
To generate the diagnostic plots, pass `--roi=middle` e specify the path to a folder where to store the plots using `--plot-dir`.

When processing larger Hi-C matrix, StripePy can take advantage of multicore processors.

The maximum number of CPU cores use by StripePy can be changed through option `--nproc` (set to 1 core by default).

Whenever possible, we recommend using 4-8 CPU cores.
Using more than 8 CPU cores is unlikely to result in significantly better computational performance (that is unless your Hi-C dataset is particularly dense).

#### 4) Fetch stripes in BEDPE format

The `.hdf5` file produced by `stripepy call` contains various kinds of information, including stripe coordinates, various descriptive statistics, persistence vectors, and more.

While having access to all this information can be useful, usually we are mostly interested in the stripe coordinates, which can be fetched using `stripepy view`.

```console
# Fetch the first 10 stripes in BEDPE format
user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy view 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 | head

chr1	2170000	2230000	chr1	2190000	3500000

# Redirect stdout to a file
user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy view 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 > stripes.bedpe

# Compress stripes on the fly before writing to a file
user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy view 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 | gzip -9 > stripes.bedpe.gz
```

If you are interested in the biodescriptors associated with each individual stripe, you can pass `--with-header` and `--with-biodescriptors` when calling `stripepy view`.

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>

This is the output generated by running `stripepy view` on the `.hdf5` generated using `stripepy call` v1.0.0.

#### 5) Quickly visualize architectural stripes

It is often a good idea to visually inspect at least some of the stripes to make sure that the used parameters are suitable for the dataset that was given to `stripepy call`.

We provide a Jupyter notebook ([visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb](utils/visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb)) to facilitate this visual inspection.
The notebook expects the input file to be in `.mcool` format.

If your matrix is in `.hic` format you can easily convert it to `.mcool` format using hictk by running `hictk convert matrix.hic matrix.mcool`.
HiGlass cannot visualize single-resolution Cooler files. If you are working with `.cool` files you can use hictk to generate `.mcool` files by running `hictk zoomify matrix.cool matrix.mcool`.

For more details, please refer to hictk's documentation: [hictk.readthedocs.io](https://hictk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart_cli.html).

We recommend running the notebook using [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install).

Furthermore, the notebook depends on a few Python packages that can be installed with `pip`.
Please make sure that the following packages are installed in a virtual environment that is accessible from Jupyter.
Refer to [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) documentation for instructions on how to add a virtual environment to Jupyter.

```bash
pip install 'clodius>=0.20,<1' 'hictkpy>=1,<2' 'higlass-python>=1.2,<2'
```

Next, launch JupyterLab and open notebook [visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb](utils/visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb).

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Before running the notebook, scroll down to the following cell

```jupyter
mcool = ensure_file_exists("CHANGEME.mcool")
bedpe = ensure_file_exists("CHANGEME.bedpe")
```

and set the `mcool` and `bedpe` variables to the path to the `.mcool` file used to call stripes and the path to the stripe coordinates extracted with `stripepy view`, respectively.

```jupyter
mcool = ensure_file_exists("4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool")
bedpe = ensure_file_exists("stripes.bedpe")
```

Now you are ready to run all cells.

Running the last cell will display a HiGlass window embedded in the Jupyter notebook (note that the interface may take a while to load).

StripePy comes with a `plot` subcommand that can be used to generate various kinds of plots.

`stripepy plot` supports the following subcommands:

- `contact-map` (`cm`): plot stripes and other features over the Hi-C matrix
- `pseudodistribution` (`pd`): plot the pseudo-distribution over the given region of interest
- `stripe-hist` (`hist`): generate and plot the histograms showing the distribution of the stripe heights and widths

`stripepy cm` takes as input a Hi-C matrix in `.cool`, `.mcool`, or `.hic` format, and optionally the `.hdf5` file generated by `stripepy call`
(this parameter is mandatory when highlighting stripes or stripe seeds).

`stripepy pd` and `stripepy hist` do not require the Hi-C matrix file, and require the `.hdf5` file generated by `stripepy call` instead.

All three subcommands support specifying a region of interest through the `--region` option.
When the commands are run without specifying the region of interest, `stripepy cm` and `stripepy pd` will generate plots for a random 2.5 Mbp region,
while `stripepy hist` will generate histograms using data from the entire genome.

Example usage:

```bash
# Plot the pseudo-distribution over a region of interest
stripepy plot pd 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 /tmp/pseudodistribution.png --region chr2:120100000-122100000

# Plot the histograms using genome-wide data
stripepy plot hist 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 /tmp/stripe_hist_gw.png

# Plot the Hi-C matrix
stripepy plot cm 4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool 10000 /tmp/matrix.png

# Plot the Hi-C matrix highlighting the stripe seeds
stripepy plot cm 4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool 10000 /tmp/matrix_with_seeds.png --stripepy-hdf5 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 --highlight-seeds

# Plot the Hi-C matrix highlighting the architectural stripes
stripepy plot cm 4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool 10000 /tmp/matrix_with_stripes.png --stripepy-hdf5 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 --highlight-stripes
```

    Architectural stripes in Hi-C and related data are crucial for gene regulation, development, and DNA repair.
    Despite their importance, few tools exist for automatic stripe detection.
    We introduce StripePy, which leverages computational geometry methods to identify and analyze architectural stripes in contact maps from Chromosome Conformation Capture experiments like Hi-C and Micro-C.
    StripePy outperforms existing tools, as shown through tests on various datasets and a newly developed simulated benchmark, StripeBench, providing a valuable resource for the community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.@
