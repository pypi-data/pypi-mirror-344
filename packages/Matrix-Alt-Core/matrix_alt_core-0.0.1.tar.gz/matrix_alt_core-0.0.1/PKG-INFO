# Matrix-Alt-Core

**Matrix-Alt-Core** is a Matrix-themed Python framework that simplifies defining and running **Agents**. Agents are tasks that you can easily customize by overriding methods, with built-in support for parallel execution, logging, dynamic properties, and more.

Made by **FRC Team 488** (*Subteam: The Matrix*), Matrix-Alt-Core provides the foundational tools for building complex, efficient agent-based systems.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Define Agents**: Create tasks by subclassing the `Agent` class and overriding core methods.
- **Parallel Execution**: Easily run agents concurrently.
- **Automatic Logging**: Built-in logging system for task activity.
- **Dynamic Properties**: Seamlessly define and manage agent attributes.
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Focus on your task's logic, while the framework handles the infrastructure.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

Matrix-Alt-Core provides the core infrastructure for:
- Creating and managing Agents.
- Running tasks in parallel or sequentially.
- Tracking agent states and properties automatically.
- Integrating easily into larger systems (e.g., robotics, vision, localization).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Matrix-Alt-Core, install the package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install Matrix-Alt-Core
```

Then create your first agent:

```python
from Alt.Core.Agents import Agent

class AgentExample(Agent):
    """ 
    This example agent shows how simple it can be to create a task.
    
    This agent creates a name property (which allows you to change its name), 
    and then it tells it to you 50 times before ending.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.nameProp = None
        self.projectNameProp = None
        self.timesRun = 0

    def create(self):
        """ Initialize the agent's properties. """
        self.nameProp = self.propertyOperator.createProperty(
            propertyTable="agent_name", propertyDefault="Bob"
        )
        self.projectNameProp = self.propertyOperator.createReadOnlyProperty(
            propertyName="agent_name_readonly", propertyValue="bob"
        )
        self.timesRun = 0

    def runPeriodic(self):
        """ Periodic task loop. """
        self.timesRun += 1
        name = self.nameProp.get()
        self.projectNameProp.set(name)
        self.Sentinel.info(f"My name is {name}")

    def onClose(self):
        """ Cleanup when the task is closed. """
        if self.nameProp is not None:
            self.Sentinel.info(f"My time has come. Never forget the name {self.nameProp.get()}!")

    def isRunning(self):
        """ Condition to keep the task running. """
        return self.timesRun < 50

    def forceShutdown(self):
        """ Force shutdown the task. """
        self.Sentinel.info("Shutdown!")

    def getDescription(self):
        """ Return the task description. """
        return "Agent_Example_Process"

    def getIntervalMs(self):
        """ Return the time interval between task runs. """
        return 1000  # 1 second

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from Alt.Core import Neo

    n = Neo()
    """ You can run as many agents as you have cpu cores
        Here one agent runs in the background, and another runs on the main thread
    """

    n.wakeAgent(AgentExample, isMainThread=False)
    n.wakeAgent(AgentExample, isMainThread=True)
    n.shutDown()
```

🛠 Project Origins

Matrix-Alt-Core was developed by FRC Team 488, under the subteam name The Matrix. The framework is designed for use in robotics and other complex systems, where tasks (or agents) need to be defined, executed, and managed efficiently in a multi-threaded or parallel environment.
