# MyoVerse - The AI toolkit for myocontrol research

## What is MyoVerse? 
MyoVerse is your cutting-edge **research** companion for unlocking the secrets hidden within biomechanical data! It's specifically designed for exploring the complex interplay between **electromyography (EMG)** signals, **kinematics** (movement), and **kinetics** (forces).

Leveraging the power of **PyTorch** and **PyTorch Lightning**, MyoVerse provides a comprehensive suite of tools, including:
*   **Data loaders** and **preprocessing filters** tailored for biomechanical signals.
*   Peer-reviewed **AI models** and components for analysis and prediction tasks.
*   Essential **utilities** to streamline the research workflow.

Whether you're predicting movement from muscle activity, analyzing forces during motion, or developing novel AI approaches for biomechanical challenges, MyoVerse aims to accelerate your research journey.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> MyoVerse is built for **research**. While powerful, it's evolving and may not have the same level of stability as foundational libraries like NumPy. We appreciate your understanding and contributions!

## Installation

MyoVerse automatically installs with the correct PyTorch version for your platform.

### Basic installation:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install myoverse
```

This will automatically:
- On Linux: Install PyTorch and TorchVision from PyPI (with CUDA support)
- On Windows: Install PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA 12.4 support

## Development

For development, install the dev dependencies:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NsquaredLab/MyoVerse.git # Replace with your actual repo URL if different
    cd MyoVerse
    ```
2.  **Install uv:** If you don't have it yet, install `uv`. Follow the instructions on the [uv GitHub page](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
3.  **Set up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies:** Simply run:
    ```bash
    uv sync --group dev
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The project is configured to automatically install:
> - On Linux: Standard PyTorch with CUDA from PyPI
> - On Windows: PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 support from the PyTorch custom index

## What is what?
This project uses the following structure:
- `myoverse`: This is the main package. It contains:
  - `datasets`: Contains data loaders, dataset creators, and a wide array of filters to preprocess your biomechanical data (e.g., EMG, kinematics).
  - `models`: Contains all AI models and their components, ready for training and evaluation.
  - `utils`: Various utilities to support data handling, model training, and analysis.
- `docs`: Contains the source files for the documentation.
- `examples`: Contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the package, including tutorials (`01_tutorials`) and specific use cases like applying filters (`02_filters`).
- `tests`: Contains tests to ensure package integrity and correctness.
