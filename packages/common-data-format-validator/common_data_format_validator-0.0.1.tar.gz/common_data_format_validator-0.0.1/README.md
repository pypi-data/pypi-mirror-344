# âš½ Common Data Format Schema Validator
JSON and JSONLines Schema Validition for the Soccer Common Data Format (Anzer et al. 2025)

----

### How To

#### 1. Install package

`pip install common-data-format-validator`

#### 2. Create your own schema
Create your data schema according to the Common Data Format specificiations for any of:
- Offical Match Data
- Meta Data
- Event Data
- Tracking Data
- Skeletal Tracking Data

#### 3. Test your schema
Once you have created your schema, you can check it's validity using the available SchemaValidators for each of the above mentioned data types.

```python
from cdf import (
    TrackingSchemaValidator, 
    MetaSchemaValidator, 
    EventSchemaValidator,
    MatchSchemaValidator    
)

# Example valid tracking data
validator = TrackingSchemaValidator()
validator.validate_schema(
    sample="cdf/files/sample/tracking_v0.2.0.jsonl"
)
```

----

### Note

The validator checks:
- All mandatory fields are provided
- Snake case is adhered for each key and for values (except for player names, city names, venue names etc.)
- Data types are correct (e.g. boolean, integer etc.)
- Value entries for specific fields are correct (e.g. period type can only be one of 5 values)
- Position groups and positions follow naming conventions in CDF Appendix C Figure 7

The validator (currently) does not check:
- British spelling
- Correct pitch dimensions
- Color codes are hex (e.g. #FFC107)
- If player_ids (or other ids) in meta are in tracking, event etc. or vice versa
- Position labels fit within the formation specifications
