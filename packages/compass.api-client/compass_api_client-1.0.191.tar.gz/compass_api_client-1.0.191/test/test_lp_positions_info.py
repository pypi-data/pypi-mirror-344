    Compass API

      #### Welcome to the DeFi API from [Compass Labs](https://www.compasslabs.ai)!  Our API allows you to interact and transact in DeFi with ease.  We help you construct your transactions via a **simple REST API**.   You maintain custody at all times and **sign** all transactions **yourself**.  Below is the documentation of our endpoints. It's a great first step to explore.    ---  **Try out our [App](https://api-app.compasslabs.ai/) built on top of the API!**  ---
