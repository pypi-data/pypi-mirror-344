make install-dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run linter:

```bash
make lint-license
```

Run all pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make pre-commit-refresh
```

---

##  Build a binary (optional)

##  Code Licensing & Attribution

- Licensed under **MPL-2.0**.
- Files include SPDX headers and author metadata.

- Please use the following before committing:

```bash
make annotate-SPD
make add-author
```

---

### Changing the Copyright Holder

To change the copyright holder name inserted into source files:

1. Create a file named `COPYRIGHT_HOLDER` in the root of the repository, and write your name or your organization‚Äôs name in it.
   For example:

   ```bash
   echo "Your Name or Organization" > COPYRIGHT_HOLDER
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This file is `.gitignore`'d and should not be committed.

2. Run `make annotate-SPD` (or the relevant pre-commit hook) to re-annotate modified source files with the new copyright holder name.

   - This target internally calls `reuse annotate` to update SPDX headers.
   - Only `.py` and `.sh` files tracked by git are affected.

   ```bash
   make annotate-SPD
   ```

> **Important**: The value in `COPYRIGHT_HOLDER` must be under 50 characters.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please make sure your commits are signed off (DCO) and that you run the following before pushing:

### üñã What is "signed off (DCO)"?

By signing off your commits, you certify that you wrote the code or have the right to submit it under the project's license.

To sign off a commit, use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
