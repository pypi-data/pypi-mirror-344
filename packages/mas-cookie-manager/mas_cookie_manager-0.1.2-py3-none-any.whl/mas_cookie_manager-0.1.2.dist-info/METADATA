# MAS Cookie Manager

MAS Cookie Manager is a lightweight and reliable Streamlit component for managing client-side cookies easily.

## Why MAS Cookie Manager?

Streamlit is a powerful framework for building interactive apps, but it lacks built-in support for client-side cookies.  
MAS Cookie Manager solves this gap by offering a simple, efficient, and production-ready solution for cookie handling inside Streamlit apps.

## Features

- Set cookies with expiration support.
- Get cookies without manual parsing.
- Remove cookies easily.
- Fully client-side, no backend needed.
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with Streamlit workflows.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mas-cookie-manager
```

## Usage Example

```python
import streamlit as st
from mas_cookie_manager import cookie_manager

st.title("MAS Cookie Manager Demo")

if st.button("Set Cookie"):
    cookie_manager(action="set", name="user_id", value="hello123", days=7)

if st.button("Get Cookie"):
    user_id = cookie_manager(action="get", name="user_id")
    if user_id:
        st.write(f"Cookie value: {user_id}")

if st.button("Remove Cookie"):
    cookie_manager(action="remove", name="user_id")
```

## How It Works

MAS Cookie Manager uses a lightweight JavaScript Streamlit component to access and control browser cookies directly through `document.cookie`.  
There are no server-side dependencies, making it simple and fast.

## Roadmap

Version 2.0 is under active development.  
Upcoming features will include:

- Built-in hashing support for cookie values (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512).
- Encryption options for sensitive cookie data.
- Extended cookie attributes like `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`.
- Cookie namespacing for better organization.

Hashing functionality will be a key focus in the next release to improve the security of cookie handling.
