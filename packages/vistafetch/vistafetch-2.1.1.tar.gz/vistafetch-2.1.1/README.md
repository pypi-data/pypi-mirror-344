## ⚡️ Quickstart
Please ensure that `vistafetch` is installed on your machine by running the following command:
```bash
pip install vistafetch
```
The first step is to initiate the client (`VistaFetchClient`):
```python
from vistafetch import VistaFetchClient

client = VistaFetchClient()
```

### 🔎 Exploratory search
The client now enables you to search for assets and allows you to investigate the results:
```python
result = client.search_asset(
    search_term="S&P",
)
result.visualize()
```
This produces the following console output:
```bash
               Financial assets discovered                
┏━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Index ┃      Name      ┃   Asset Type   ┃     ISIN     ┃
┡━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│   0   │    S&P 500     │     INDEX      │ US78378X1072 │
│   1   │ Siemens Energy │     STOCK      │ DE000ENER6Y0 │
│   2   │  Silberpreis   │ PRECIOUS_METAL │ XC0009653103 │
│   3   │      SAP       │     STOCK      │ DE0007164600 │
│   4   │ EURO STOXX 50  │     INDEX      │ EU0009658145 │
└───────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘
```
One now can access the asset of choice:
```python
asset = result.get(3)  # returns SAP in this case

# in case one simply wants the first one, the following shorthand takes you there
asset = result.get()
```
One can now access several parameters of the asset or convert them to a JSON string as show below.
```python
print(asset.isin)
print(asset.as_json())
```
```bash
DE0007164600
{
  "display_type":"Aktie",
  "entity_type":"STOCK",
  "isin":"DE0007164600",
  "name":"SAP",
  "tiny_name":"SAP",
  "wkn":"716460",
}
```

As a final step, the asset provides some recent price-related data:
```python
print(asset.get_latest_price_data().as_json())
```
```bash
{
  "currency_symbol":"EUR",
  "datetime_high":"2023-08-25T14:17:15Z",
  "datetime_last":"2023-08-25T15:37:14Z",
  "datetime_low":"2023-08-25T15:02:12Z",
  "datetime_open":"2023-08-25T07:00:26.999000Z",
  "high":127.24,
  "last":126.16,
  "low":125.66,
  "open":126.2,
}
```

In addition, you directly access the individual values, e.g., price value `last`:
```python
asset.get_latest_price_data().last
```
```bash
126.16
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Price data are currently not supported for indexes.
> Feel free to send me a feature request if you'd like to see this feature
> supported for other asset types as well: https://github.com/bossenti/vistafetch/issues/new.
> As an alternative, contributions are welcome at any time.

### 🎯 Targeted search
In case you already know the identifier for your asset (both ISIN and WKN are supported),
you can directly query them. This returns then only one result:
```python
result = client.search_asset(
    search_term="DE0007164600",  # alternatively pass the WKN here
)
sap_stock = result.get()
```

## 🐛 Facing problems

### Initial Setup
For your convenience, please ensure that you have Poetry and Just installed. You can read more on them by following the links below:
* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

To get all required dependencies installed, simply start with:
```bash
just poetry-install
```
Additionally, we make use of [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit). To set it up, run the following command:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

To verify that everything is set up correctly, execute the test suite:
```bash
just unit-tests
```

### Code Conformance

Once you implemented your changes, please run the following commands:
```bash
just pretty   # formats the code and applies automatic linting fixes
just check  # checks code for conformance
```
