# Getting Started

On this page, we will run through a step-by-step example in which we will build an experiment from scratch. In this example we will introduce the concepts of `SoftwareInstruments`, `HardwareInstruments` and `Measurements` to interface with a Stanford Instruments Sr830 Lock-In Amplifier in order to record timestamped voltages. The process is generic to other instruments and measurements.

# Adding software instruments

A `SoftwareInstrument` is an instrument not associated with any physical hardware. We anticipate that the `Clock` will be
included in most experiments to handle the production of timestamps, times and dates.
