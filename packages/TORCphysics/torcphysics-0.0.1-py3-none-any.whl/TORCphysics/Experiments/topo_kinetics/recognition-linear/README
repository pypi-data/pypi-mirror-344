Here, we want to calibrate using the same Linear effect model and using Fenfei's paper (kinetic study)

Calibration method:
* Models will be calibrated just using a particular substrate concentration [S], and the code will be independent of this
  variable
* The calibration consists in a 3 curve fittings:
  1.- Gyrase has to approximate the kinetic curve
  2.- Topo I has to approximate to its corresponding kinetic curve
  3.- Kinetic curve will be created combining both Gyrase and topo I, and the simulation has to approximate that curve.
* This means that topo I and Gyrase will be calibrated at the same time.
* A random search algorithm will be employed

TopoI:
* Binding model = Recognition Binding
* Effect model = Linear effect
* Unbinding model = Poisson unbinding

Gyrase:
* Binding model = Recognition Binding
* Effect model = Linear effect
* Unbinding model = Poisson unbinding
