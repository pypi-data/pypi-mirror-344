The data collected here is from the paper:
Assessing in vivo the impact of gene context on transcription through DNA supercoiling

With authors: Ihab Boulas, Lisa Bruno, Sylvie Rimsky, Olivier Espeli, Ivan Junier, Olivier Rivoire

* For the experimental data (weak.csv, medium.csv, strong.csv), I collected it from their data that they uploaded to
github (in the Notebook folder).

* For the biophysical model data, I reproduced it by running their codes (uploaded in their github page) using the
same distances than experiments for the upstream barrier, and using the parameters reported in their paper for the
weak, medium and strong promoter. The data collected is named as model_case-norm.csv, with case being = weak,medium,strong
