These results are for calibrating the stochastic topoisomerase models.
Each folder corresponds to a different model.
Calibration is based on experimental study: Kinetic Study of DNA Topoisomerases by Supercoiling-Dependent Fluorescence Quenching

environment_small.csv - corresponds to topo I and gyrase smaller sizes, which are based on crystollographic structures.
In that sense, this evironment is more realistic.
