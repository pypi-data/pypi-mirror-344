           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

- Author: Yi Zhang, PhD, yi.zhang@duke.edu
- Website: [Yi Zhang Lab at Duke](https://yi-zhang-compbio-lab.github.io)
- STHDviewer of VisiumHD colon cancer sample with near 9 million spots: STHDviewer_colon_cancer_HD:[https://yi-zhang-compbio-lab.github.io/STHDviewer_colon_cancer_hd](https://yi-zhang-compbio-lab.github.io/STHDviewer_colon_cancer_hd/STHDviewer_crchd.html)
- We provided [test data](https://duke.box.com/v/yi-zhang-duke-sthd-test). Download this folder and put as `./testdata/`

## Install
---
- python version requirement: >=3.8.0
- How to use
  - create new python venv `python3.8 -m venv sthd_env`
  - activate the venv `source sthd_env/bin/activate`
  - Install STHD from pip: `pip install STHD`
  - Or:
      - download repo: `git clone git@github.com:yi-zhang/STHD.git`
      - install dependencies: `pip install -r STHD/requirements.txt`
      - making sure `./STHD` is in python path, e.g adding via `sys.path.append('./STHD')`
      - then in script: `from STHD import {the module you need}`


## STHD Quickstart using a colon cancer VisiumHD patch:

- See `notebooks/tutorial.ipynb`
- The test data includes a patch crop from the VisiumHD file in `testdata/crop10`

---

## STHD pipeline on a larger VisiumHD region, or the full VisiumHD sample:

### Step 1: prepare normalized gene expression profile (lambda) by cell type from reference scRNA-seq data.

- This step will generate the reference file. Details are in  `notebooks/s01_build_ref_scrna.ipynb`
- We provided the processed file `./testdata/crc_average_expr_genenorm_lambda_98ct_4618gs.txt`

### Step 2: pre-processing of VisiumHD data files

- The test data includes a larger region from the VisiumHD file in `testdata/crop10large/`
  
#### Preparing the VisiumHD sample. 
- 10X Genomics colon cancer sample can be downloaded from: https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-of-human-crc
- Required input includes 2um level spatial expression: `square_002um` , which usually contains filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5 and spatial/tissue_positions.csv . It is often from the downloaded folder "Binned outputs (all bin levels)". tissue positions in .parquet format can be converted using STHD/hdpp.py.
- Required input also includes full-resolution H&E image: Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_tissue_image.btf. It is often from the "Microscope image".
- The scale factor number will also be useful, which is usually in square_002um/spatial/scalefactors_json.json
- Our processed data files are available as in: `testdata/VisiumHD/`

### Step 3: Patchify the large region

- This step will take a large region and split into patches. Details are in `notebooks/s11_patchify.ipynb`
- Or, use example command line:

```bash
# Spliting patches from a test large cropped data:
python3 -m STHD.patchify \
--spatial_path ./testdata/crop10large/all_region/adata.h5ad.gzip \
--full_res_image_path ./testdata/crop10large/all_region/fullresimg_path.json \
--load_type crop \
--dx 1500 \
--dy 1500 \
--scale_factor 0.07973422 \
--refile ./testdata/crc_average_expr_genenorm_lambda_98ct_4618gs.txt \
--save_path ./testdata/crop10large_patchify \
--mode split
```

- For full sample, example command line below (will take some space and time)

```bash
# Spliting patches from the full-size VisiumHD sample:
python3 -m STHD.patchify \
--spatial_path ./testdata/VisiumHD/square_002um/ \
--counts_data filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5 \
--full_res_image_path ./testdata/VisiumHD/Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_tissue_image.btf \
--load_type original \
--dx 6000 \
--dy 6000 \
--scale_factor 0.07973422 \
--refile ./testdata/crc_average_expr_genenorm_lambda_98ct_4618gs.txt \
--save_path ./analysis/full_patchify \
--mode split
```

### Step 4: Obtain training command line for the patch list

- This step trains STHD on each patch. The command can be flexibly modified to submit to different slurm jobs on a HPC. Details are in  `notebooks/s12_per_patch_train.ipynb` ,Or,
- Example command is:

```bash
python3 -m STHD.train --refile ./testdata/crc_average_expr_genenorm_lambda_98ct_4618gs.txt \
--patch_list ./testdata/crop10large/patches/52979_9480 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/57479_9480 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/52979_7980 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/55979_7980 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/57479_7980 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/54479_9480 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/55979_9480 ./testdata/crop10large/patches/54479_7980
```

### Step 5: Combine the patch results

- This step combines STHD patch-wise results together. Details are in  `notebooks/s13_combine_patch.ipynb`, Or

```bash
#Combine predictions
python3 -m STHD.patchify \
--refile ./testdata/crc_average_expr_genenorm_lambda_98ct_4618gs.txt \
--save_path ./testdata/crop10large_patchify \
--mode combine
```

### Step 6: Visualize!

- This step takes STHD results on a large region and generate STHDviewer for interactive exploration. Details are in `notebooks/s21_visualize.ipynb`

### Step 7: Downstream analyses

- One example is STHD-guided binning using a size of choice for —nspot
- Details are in `notebooks/s04_STHD_cell_type_guided_binning.ipynb`; Or.

```bash
python -m STHD.binning_fast --patch_path ./testdata/crop10/ --nspot 4 --outfile ./testdata/crop10_STHDbin_nspot4.h5ad
```
