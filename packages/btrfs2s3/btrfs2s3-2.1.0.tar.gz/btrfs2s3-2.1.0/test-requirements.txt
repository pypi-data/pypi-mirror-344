# btrfs2s3 requires --system-site-packages. This means we can generally end
# up pulling in weird package versions in configurations that don't exist any
# other way. In particular on Ubuntu 20.04, we can end up with
# system-provided python3-openssl (version 19.0.0), but will end up
# installing a newer version of cryptography. The old pyopenssl breaks with
# the newer cryptography. This would resolve itself if pyopenssl had a proper
# dependency like "cryptography>=X,<Y", but this was only introduced in newer
# pyopenssl.
pyopenssl>=22.1
# similarly: we pull markupsafe>=2, which breaks jinja2<3, but moto depends
# only on jinja2>=2.10.1
jinja2>=3
