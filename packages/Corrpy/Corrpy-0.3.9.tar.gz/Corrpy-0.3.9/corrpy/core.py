    "1. **Correlation Analysis:** It first runs various correlation checks like:\n"
    "   - Numeric vs. Numeric (using `getLabled`)\n"
    "   - Numeric vs. Object (using `getCorrObjDtype`)\n"
    "   - Object vs. Object (using `Nordinal.getObjvsObj`)\n"
    "   - Transitive relations (indirect links)\n"
    "2. **Insight Generation:** It then feeds this summary to a large language model \n"
    "(Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 from Together.ai). \n"
    "3. **Storytelling:** The AI crafts a narrative explaining the key findings in a way \n"
    "that's clear, concise, and actionable.\n\n"
    "🚀 **Why use it?**\n"
    "• **Bridge the technical gap:** Explain complex correlations to non-technical audiences \n"
    "without jargon or code.\n"
    "• **Save time:** Automate the creation of insightful correlation reports.\n"
    "• **Focus on actions:** The narrative highlights the 'So what?' to drive decision-making.\n\n"
    "🚨 **Important:**\n"
    "Requires an API token from Together.ai (free tier available).\n"
    "The method will guide you through setting this up."

    "It's like having a data analyst interpret how a target feature reacts to changes in an input feature.\n\n"
    "⚙️ **How it works:**\n"
    "1. **Shift Calculation:** It first uses the `shift` method to calculate the drift (change in the \n"
    "target feature's predicted mean) when the input feature is shifted by a percentage (`shiftValue`).\n"
    "2. **AI Interpretation:** This drift information is then sent to Together.ai's language model \n"
    "(Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8).\n"
    "3. **Explanation:** The AI provides a clear explanation of the observed drift, telling you if \n"
    "it's significant, increasing, decreasing, or negligible, in plain language.\n\n"
    "🚀 **Why use it?**\n"
    "• **Gain deeper understanding:** Easily grasp the impact of input changes on your target feature \n"
    "without complex analysis.\n"
    "• **Communicate insights:** Share clear, concise explanations of drift with stakeholders.\n\n"

    🧠 **You are a skilled data analyst AI agent.**
      You have been given a task to explain the output of a method called `shift`, which is used to estimate how a dependent variable (say, target feature) changes when the independent variable (input feature) is slightly shifted.

      📊 Here's the **output** of the `shift` method:
        ```
        {shiftedDF}
        ```
        Explain In {emotionsDict[mode]} way and u are {characterTemplate[character]} and instead of taking name column num1 num2 use acutal name of columns given in dataframe {shiftedDF}
        🔧 The `shift` method takes **4 parameters**:
        1. `num1` – Name of the independent variable (input feature)
        2. `num2` – Name of the dependent variable (target feature)
        3. `shiftValue` – The percentage by which we want to shift the independent variable
        4. `df` – The input DataFrame

    🧪 **How it works:**
        - A linear regression model is trained using `num1` to predict `num2`.
        - Then, the input feature `num1` is shifted by a percentage (`shiftValue`) to simulate change.
        - New predictions are made with this shifted data.
        - The difference between the original and new predictions is analyzed to compute the **drift**.

        📈 **The output** contains 4 columns:
        1. **% Drift** – The percentage change in the predicted mean after shift
        2. **Previous Mean** – The mean of the original target variable (`num2`)
        3. **New Mean** – The mean of the predicted target values after shifting input
        4. **Difference** – The absolute change between new and previous means

        🎯 **Your Task:**
        - Analyze the `shiftedDF` output.
        - Interpret what the values say about how the target feature reacts to a change in the input feature.
        - Help explain if the drift is significant, increasing, decreasing, or negligible.
          dont show any code in output just explain the output in storymode

          make output compact so that user dosen't feel bore

Use the correlation summary below and return an insightful, business-friendly explanation in simple words, ideal for non-technical stakeholders.

The goal is to explain whether the observed relationship between '{firstFeature}' and '{secondFeature}' is real, or if it's caused by their mutual connection with '{ThirdFeature}'.

Use the partial correlation value of {transitScore:.2f} to support your explanation. Be clear, concise, and focus on real-world implications without technical jargon.


Explain in TWO LINES JUST but break in middles to avoid scorrling right side so much
and show the report at last directly for proof without any md format

Use the correlation summary below and return an insightful, human-readable analysis with a business-friendly tone. Avoid technical jargon.

Your goal:
- Spot **transitive relationships** between features by analyzing how removing an intermediate variable (e.g., {feature}) affects the correlation between others.
- Explain if any **indirect influences** or **hidden drivers** are revealed.
- Highlight surprising patterns, such as **false correlations** that vanish when context is removed.
- Use words like **insight**, **inference**, **causal clue**, **hidden linkage**, and **business signal** to add clarity and engagement.

Return a short report that a CEO or product manager would easily understand and act upon.
keep it within 3 lines and break lines in middle so that user dont have to scroll infinitely
keep the para plain no md format

and at last explain each thing
1. What removed
2. What effects before and after
3. Whats the result
4. Is this really transitive or not
keep check the cols put correct names of cols {transitDF}
and add emojies to make this attractive report
always try to answer in {mode} way to make it more interactive
and add sarcasm where u can
