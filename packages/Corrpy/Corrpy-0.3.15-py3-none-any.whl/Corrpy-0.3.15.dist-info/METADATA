**CorrPY** is your lightweight buddy for fast, smart correlation analysis.  
Forget just numbers — CorrPY tells you **what they *mean***. 📊✨

Built for data scientists who want **insights**, not just values.

---

## 🚀 Install

```bash
pip install corrpy
```

---

## 📦 Quickstart

```python
from corrpy import Corrpy

corrpy = Corrpy()
corrpy.getTotalCorrRelation(df)
```

✅ Analyze correlation across features  
✅ Get trends + easy-to-read interpretations  
✅ Go deeper with AI explanations (optional)

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Numerical vs Numerical** — Classic correlations + strength.
- **Object vs Numerical** — Category impacts, clear trends.
- **Object vs Object** — Categorical association (Chi2).
- **Transitive Trap Alerts** — Detect hidden indirect links. 🚨
- **AI-Generated Insights** — Explain data like a boss 🧠📜

---

### All Methods you can use 
1. `getTotalCorrRelation(df, features = ["Correlation", "Pearson", "Distance"], feature = "Correlation", short = False, prompt = "Explain me like Elon Musk")`: Pass a pandas DataFrame to get correlation analysis across all columns and get trends, interpretations and score with respect to feature u added in parameter.

2. `getGroupInf(objColumn, numColumn, df, prompt = "Explain like Obama")`: Compute the correlation between the given object column and the given numeric column.
3. `getAllGroupInf(df, prompt = "Explain like alien")`: Compute the correlation between all object columns and all numeric columns.
4. `setApi()`: Securely handles your [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai/) API token.
5. `explainAITC(df, feature="Correlation", character="Data analyst", mode="Confused", prompt = "Explain me like I'm 5")`: Get AI insights for correlation analysis.
6. `shift(num1, num2, shiftValue, df)`: Test how your dependent variable reacts to small changes in an input variable.
7. `explainShift(num1, num2, shiftValue, df, character = "Data analyst", mode = "Funny...", prompt = "Explain like a stand-up comedian")`: An AI analyst explains the output of `shift()` like you're in a meeting with your CEO.
8. `checkTransit(firstFeature, secondFeature, ThirdFeature, prompt = "Explain like Modi")`: Check for transitive correlation between three features.
9. `explainPartialCorrelation(num1, num2, df, character = "Data analyst", mode = "Funny...", prompt = "Explain like Angry Professor")`: Get AI insights for partial correlation analysis.
10. `checkTransitForColumn(column, df, prompt = "Explain like Mahatma Gandhi")`: Check for transitive correlation between a column and all other columns.
11. `explainTransitForcolumn(column, df, character = "Data analyst", mode = "Funny...", prompt = "Explain like Oppenheimer")`: An AI analyst explains the output of `checkTransitForColumn()` like you're in a meeting with your CEO.

12. `explainAI(result, character = "Data analyst", mode = "Funny...", prompt = "Explain like angry professor")`: Get AI insights for any result.
