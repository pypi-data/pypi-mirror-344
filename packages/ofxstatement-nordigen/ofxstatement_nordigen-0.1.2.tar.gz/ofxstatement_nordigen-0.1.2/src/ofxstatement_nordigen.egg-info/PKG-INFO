~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A plugin for `ofxstatement`_ to parse transaction data from GoCardless (previously known as Nordigen).

`ofxstatement`_ is a tool to convert proprietary bank statement to OFX format,
suitable for importing to GnuCash. Plugin for ofxstatement parses a
particular proprietary bank statement format and produces common data
structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.

Installation
================

To install the plugin, you can use `pip`_:

.. _pip: https://pypi.org/project/pip/

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install ofxstatement-nordigen

or, if you want to install it in editable mode (for development), use:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e ./

To verify that the plugin is installed correctly, you can run:

.. code-block:: shell

    ofxstatement --list-plugins

This should list the ``nordigen`` plugin among other plugins.

Usage
================

To use the plugin, you can run the ``ofxstatement`` command with the ``--plugin`` option:

.. code-block:: shell

    ofxstatement convert -t nordigen <input_file> <output_file>

Replace ``<input_file>`` with the path to your input file and ``<output_file>`` with the desired output file name.

The input file should be a JSON of transactions from GoCardless that has the schema defined `here`_.

.. _here: https://developer.gocardless.com/bank-account-data/transactions

The output file will be an OFX file that can be imported into GnuCash or other financial software.

Configuration
================

Configuration can be edited using the ``ofxstatement edit-config`` command.
The following parameters are available:

- ``account_id``: The account ID to use for the transactions. This is required.
- ``currency``: The currency to use for the account. If not specified, the currency will be determined from the transactions.

After you are done
==================

After your plugin is ready, feel free to open an issue on `ofxstatement`_
project to include your plugin in "known plugin list". That would hopefully
make life of other clients of your bank easier.
