def check_now_log_level(user_level: int):
    """
    A decorator that conditionally executes logging methods based on the current log level
    of the logger instance.

    This decorator compares the specified `user_level` of the log method
    (e.g., DEBUG=0, INFO=1, etc.) with the `level` attribute of the Logger instance.
    If the current log level is less than or equal to the method's level, the method executes.
    Otherwise, it is skipped.

    Additionally, this decorator injects the name of the calling function into the method's
    `kwargs` as `caller_name`, enabling the logger to display the source of the log message.

    Args:
        user_level (int): The severity level of the log method being decorated (0â€“4).

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped function, conditionally executed based on log level.
