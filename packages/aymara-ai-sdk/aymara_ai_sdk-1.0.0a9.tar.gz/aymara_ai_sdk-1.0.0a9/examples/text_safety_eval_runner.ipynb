    "This notebook demonstrated how to use both the synchronous `EvalRunner` and asynchronous `AsyncEvalRunner` for text-to-text safety evaluation with the AymaraAI SDK, using the updated callable interface. Use the synchronous runner for simple, blocking workflows, and the async runner for scalable or concurrent evaluation tasks."
