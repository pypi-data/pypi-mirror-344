# streamlit-concurrency

Easier and safer concurrency for streamlit.

This library provide 2 APIs:

- `run_in_executor`: transform function to run concurrently in executor (ThreadPoolExecutor)
    - with configurable caching like `st.cache_data`, even for async function
    - transformed function can access `st.session_state` and widgets from other threads
- `use_state`: manage page state in and across pages
