    "The multiprocessing module is part of the Python Standard Library and provides capabilities for running multiple processes concurrently on a multicore machine (and, if desired, communicate among those processes).  This can be useful for generating lots of statistics for our forest fire model.  In its simplest form, the module provides support for starting up a Pool of worker processes, which can run concurrently.  In the code below, we use a multiprocessing Pool to generate independent runs of our fire simulation.\n",

    "The three following code cells are used to illustrate this basic operation, but they are configured by default not to actually run, e.g., if one were to try to do a \"Restart and Run All\" for this notebook.  The first code cell defines a new Jupyter cell magic called do_not_run_in_jupyter that runs no code if it is included in a cell, and the remaining two code cells have code which is protected by this cell magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for doing this is that is some problems can arise running multiprocessing code within a Jupyter notebook.  These problems are intermittent and not entirely reproducible, and probably depend to some extent on operating systems and package versions.  One could export the Python code from this notebook, organize it in a .py source file, and run the resulting code using the python interpreter without problems on a multicore machine."
