**üöÄ Feature-rich**: All the CHONKs you'd ever need </br>
**‚ú® Easy to use**: Install, Import, CHONK </br>
**‚ö° Fast**: CHONK at the speed of light! zooooom </br>
**ü™∂ Light-weight**: No bloat, just CHONK </br>
**üåè Wide support**: CHONKie [integrates](#integrations) with your favorite tokenizer, embedding model and APIs! </br>
**üí¨ Ô∏èMultilingual**: Out-of-the-box support for 5+ language CHONKS (more coming üîú) </br>
**‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Ready**: CHONK locally or in the [Chonkie Cloud](https://cloud.chonkie.ai) </br>
**ü¶õ Cute CHONK mascot**: psst it's a pygmy hippo btw </br>
**‚ù§Ô∏è [Moto Moto](#acknowledgements)'s favorite python library** </br>

**Chonkie** is a chunking library that "**just works**" ‚ú®

# Installation

To install chonkie, run:

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

Chonkie follows the rule of minimum installs.
Have a favorite chunker? Read our [docs](https://docs.chonkie.ai) to install only what you need
Don't want to think about it? Simply install `all` (Not recommended for production environments)

```bash
pip install chonkie[all]
```

# Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
# First import the chunker you want from Chonkie
from chonkie import RecursiveChunker

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = RecursiveChunker()

# Chunk some text
chunks = chunker("Chonkie is the goodest boi! My favorite chunking hippo hehe.")

# Access chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Chunk: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}")
```

Check out more usage examples in the [docs](https://docs.chonkie.ai)!

# Chunkers

Chonkie provides several chunkers to help you split your text efficiently for RAG applications. Here's a quick overview of the available chunkers:

- **TokenChunker**: Splits text into fixed-size token chunks.
- **SentenceChunker**: Splits text into chunks based on sentences.
- **RecursiveChunker**: Splits text hierarchically using customizable rules to create semantically meaningful chunks.
- **SemanticChunker**: Splits text into chunks based on semantic similarity.
- **SDPMChunker**: Splits text using a Semantic Double-Pass Merge approach.
- **LateChunker**: Embeds text and then splits it to have better chunk embeddings.
- **CodeChunker**: Splits code into structurally meaningful chunks.
- **NeuralChunker**: Splits text using a neural model.
- **SlumberChunker**: Splits text using an LLM to find semantically meaningful chunks. Also known as _"AgenticChunker"_.

More on these methods and the approaches taken inside the [docs](https://docs.chonkie.ai)

# Integrations

Chonkie integrates smoothly with the tools you already use:

- **Tokenizers:** Choose from **3 supported tokenizers** (like `Hugging Face ü§ó` and `Tiktoken`) or provide your own custom token counting function. Flexibility first!
- **Embedding Models:** Seamlessly works with **5 out-of-the-box embedding model providers**, including `SentenceTransformers`, `Model2Vec`, `OpenAI`, `Cohere`, and `Jina AI`. Bring your favorite embeddings to the CHONK party!

# Benchmarks

> "I may be smol hippo, but I pack a big punch!" ü¶õ

Chonkie is not just cute, it's also fast and efficient! Here's how it stacks up against the competition:

**Size**üì¶

- **Default Install:** 15MB (vs 80-171MB for alternatives)
- **With Semantic:** Still 10x lighter than the closest competition!

**Speed**‚ö°

- **Token Chunking:** 33x faster than the slowest alternative
- **Sentence Chunking:** Almost 2x faster than competitors
- **Semantic Chunking:** Up to 2.5x faster than others
