	Writes tabular data to a delimited file. This is a low-quality function: you'd probably be better off with something else.

	Parameters:
		pathFilename: The path and filename where the data will be written.

		tableColumns: The column headers for the table.
		delimiterOutput (tab): The delimiter to use in the output file. Defaults to *tab*.

	that function's returned data is easily handled by this function. See https://github.com/hunterhogan/analyzeAudio
