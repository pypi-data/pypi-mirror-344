## Key Features

- Support for multiple conversations in independent windows
- Integration with python-llm for chatting with various LLM models
- Modern interface using libadwaita
- Support for real-time streaming responses
- Message history with automatic scrolling
- Markdown rendering of the responses
- **Support for fragments:** Include external content (files, URLs, or text snippets) in your prompts.
- **Conversation Management:** Rename and delete conversations.
- **Applet Mode:** Run a system tray applet for quick access to recent conversations.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from different LLM models.
- **System Prompt:** Set a custom system prompt for each conversation.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages displayed in the chat.
- **Dynamic Input:** The input area dynamically adjusts its height.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    - `Enter`: Send message.
    - `Shift+Enter`: New line in the input.

## Installation

```
pipx install llm               # required by gtk-llm-chat
llm install gtk-llm-chat
```

You may want to manually copy the .desktop files to `~/.local/share/applications/` to make them available in your application menu.

### Experimental Windows Version (NEW!)

Windows users can try our experimental version of the GTK LLM Chat app. This version is built using the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment and includes a precompiled GTK4 package.

While it is fully functional, there is no mechanism provided thru the GUI for adding plugins or API keys - and no system tray applet support either.

A welcome assistant is planned for the future, but for now, you can manually add your API keys to your `keys.json` file.

You will find the Windows version under "Releases" in the GitHub repository.
