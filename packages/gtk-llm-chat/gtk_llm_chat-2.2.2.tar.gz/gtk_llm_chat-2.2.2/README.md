## Installation

```
pipx install llm               # required by gtk-llm-chat
llm install gtk-llm-chat
```

You may want to manually copy the .desktop files to `~/.local/share/applications/` to make them available in your application menu.

### Experimental Windows Version (NEW!)

Windows users can try our experimental version of the GTK LLM Chat app. This version is built using the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment and includes a precompiled GTK4 package.

While it is fully functional, there is no mechanism provided thru the GUI for adding plugins or API keys - and no system tray applet support either.

A welcome assistant is planned for the future, but for now, you can manually add your API keys to your `keys.json` file.

You will find the Windows version under "Releases" in the GitHub repository.
