A collection of useful widgets to annotate images with overlays and export them as rgb images/movies.

With this plugin you can:
- Annotate Layers with their respective names and colors
- Annotate Layers with a timestamp
- Export the annotated layers as an RGB image or a movie
- Convert Layers to RGB stacks and add them back to the viewer

uses some private overlay functionality, so may break in the future
