Performance Tuning
===================

.. note::
   This documentation section is currently under development. The content below is a placeholder and will be expanded in future releases.

Overview
--------

This section provides guidance on tuning your Memories-Dev deployment for optimal performance across various workloads and environments.

Topics to be Covered
--------------------

* Memory tier configuration
* Query optimization parameters
* Storage backend tuning
* Vector database optimization
* Network and IO tuning
* Hardware recommendations
* Workload-specific optimizations

Configuration Parameters
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Example configuration for performance tuning
    config = Config(
        vector_db_params={
            "index_type": "HNSW",
            "ef_construction": 200,
            "M": 16
        },
        memory_params={
            "hot_memory_size": 10000,
            "warm_memory_size": 50000,
            "batch_size": 1024
        },
        storage_params={
            "compression_level": 6,
            "chunk_size": "128MB"
        }
    )

Coming Soon
----------

Detailed documentation with performance benchmarks, tuning recommendations for different hardware configurations, and advanced optimization techniques will be added in upcoming releases.
