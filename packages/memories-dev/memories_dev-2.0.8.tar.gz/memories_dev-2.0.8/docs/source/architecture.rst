Architecture
============

System Overview
---------------

memories.dev is built with a tiered architecture that efficiently manages different types of memory storage and retrieval.

Memory Tiers
------------

1. Hot Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In-memory cache using Redis
- Fastest access times
- Stores frequently accessed data
- Automatic cache invalidation

2. Warm Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Vector store for similarity search
- Fast retrieval of related memories
- Efficient indexing and updates
- Supports semantic search

3. Cold Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Object storage for raw data
- Compressed storage format
- Batch processing support
- Cost-effective storage

4. Glacier Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Long-term archival storage
- High durability guarantee
- Infrequent access pattern
- Data integrity verification

Component Interaction

    Client -> Memory System -> [Hot/Warm/Cold/Glacier] Memory
                           -> Data Acquisition
                           -> Memory Formation
                           -> Memory Processing
