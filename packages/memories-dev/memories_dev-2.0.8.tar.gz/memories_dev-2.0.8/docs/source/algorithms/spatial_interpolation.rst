Spatial Interpolation
===================

Overview
--------
Spatial interpolation is a crucial technique in the memories-dev framework for estimating values at unsampled locations based on known values at sampled points. This process is essential for creating continuous surfaces from discrete spatial data points.

Methods
-------

Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A deterministic interpolation method that assumes closer points have more influence than distant ones.

.. math::

   \hat{z}(s_0) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i z(s_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}, \quad w_i = \frac{1}{d(s_0, s_i)^p}

where:
- \(\hat{z}(s_0)\) is the predicted value at location \(s_0\)
- \(z(s_i)\) is the known value at location \(s_i\)
- \(w_i\) is the weight for location \(s_i\)
- \(d(s_0, s_i)\) is the distance between \(s_0\) and \(s_i\)
- \(p\) is the power parameter (typically 2)

Kriging
~~~~~~~
A geostatistical method that provides optimal interpolation based on regression against observed values.

.. math::

   \hat{Z}(s_0) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(s_i)

where:
- \(\hat{Z}(s_0)\) is the predicted value
- \(\lambda_i\) are the kriging weights
- \(Z(s_i)\) are the observed values

Implementation
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.spatial import SpatialInterpolator
    
    # Initialize interpolator
    interpolator = SpatialInterpolator(
        method="idw",  # or "kriging"
        power=2,  # for IDW
        variogram_model="spherical"  # for kriging
    )
    
    # Perform interpolation
    result = await interpolator.interpolate(
        points=sampled_points,
        values=known_values,
        grid=target_grid,
        uncertainty=True
    )

Validation
---------
Cross-validation techniques are used to assess interpolation accuracy:

1. Leave-one-out cross-validation
2. K-fold cross-validation
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculation

Best Practices
-------------
1. Choose appropriate interpolation method based on data characteristics
2. Consider anisotropy in spatial relationships
3. Validate results using multiple methods
4. Account for edge effects
5. Consider computational efficiency for large datasets

Applications
-----------
1. Elevation data interpolation
2. Climate variable mapping
3. Environmental parameter estimation
4. Soil property mapping
5. Population density estimation
