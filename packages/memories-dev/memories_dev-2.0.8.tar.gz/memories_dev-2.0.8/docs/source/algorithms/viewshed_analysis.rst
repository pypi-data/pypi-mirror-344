Viewshed Analysis
=================

Overview
--------
Viewshed analysis is a geospatial technique used to determine visible areas from a given observation point, taking into account terrain elevation and other obstacles. In the memories-dev framework, this analysis is crucial for understanding visibility patterns and their implications.

Core Concepts
------------

Line of Sight (LOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The direct line between an observer point and a target point.

.. math::

   \text{LOS}(p_1, p_2) = \{(x,y,z) | z = h_1 + \frac{h_2-h_1}{d}r, r \in [0,d]\}

where:
- \(p_1(x_1,y_1,h_1)\) is the observer point
- \(p_2(x_2,y_2,h_2)\) is the target point
- \(d\) is the horizontal distance between points

Visibility Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A measure of how visible a location is from multiple observation points.

.. math::

   V_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n v_{ij}}{n}

where:
- \(V_i\) is the visibility index for location i
- \(v_{ij}\) is 1 if location i is visible from point j, 0 otherwise
- \(n\) is the total number of observation points

Implementation
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.spatial import ViewshedAnalyzer
    
    # Initialize analyzer
    analyzer = ViewshedAnalyzer(
        observer_height=1.7,  # meters
        max_distance=5000,  # meters
        refraction_coefficient=0.13
    )
    
    # Perform analysis
    viewshed = await analyzer.analyze(
        dem=elevation_data,
        observer_points=points,
        resolution=10,  # meters
        parallel=True
    )

Analysis Methods
--------------

Binary Viewshed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simple visible/not-visible classification.

Cumulative Viewshed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Combines multiple viewsheds to show visibility frequency.

Weighted Viewshed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Incorporates importance weights for different observer points.

Applications
-----------
1. Urban planning and design
2. Landscape assessment
3. Infrastructure placement
4. Military planning
5. Environmental impact studies

Best Practices
-------------
1. Use high-resolution elevation data
2. Consider atmospheric refraction
3. Account for Earth's curvature
4. Validate results in the field
5. Consider temporal changes

Performance Optimization
