Decision Fusion
===================

.. note::
   This documentation is under development. More detailed content will be added in future releases.

Overview
--------

Decision fusion is a methodology for combining decisions, predictions, or outputs from multiple algorithms, models, or expert systems. In Earth memory systems, decision fusion allows for more robust analysis by integrating the strengths of different analytical approaches while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

Implementation Approaches
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Example decision fusion implementation
   def decision_fusion(model_outputs, fusion_method='majority_voting', confidences=None):
       """
       Fuse decisions from multiple models into a single decision
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       model_outputs : list
           List of outputs from different models or decision systems
       fusion_method : str
           Method to use for fusion: 'majority_voting', 'weighted_voting', 
           'bayesian', or 'stacking'
       confidences : list, optional
           Confidence scores for each model output
           
       Returns:
       --------
       Various
           Fused decision, format depends on fusion method
       """
       if fusion_method == 'majority_voting':
           # Simple majority voting for classification
           votes = np.array(model_outputs)
           counts = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: np.bincount(x, minlength=num_classes), 
                                     axis=0, arr=votes)
           return np.argmax(counts, axis=0)
           
       elif fusion_method == 'weighted_voting':
           # Weighted voting based on confidences
           if confidences is None:
               raise ValueError("Confidences required for weighted voting")
               
           votes = np.array(model_outputs)
           weighted_votes = np.zeros((num_classes, votes.shape[1]))
           
           for i, (vote, confidence) in enumerate(zip(votes, confidences)):
               for j in range(votes.shape[1]):
                   weighted_votes[vote[j], j] += confidence[j]
