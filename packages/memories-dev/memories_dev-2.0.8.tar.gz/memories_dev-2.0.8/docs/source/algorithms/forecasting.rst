Forecasting
==========

Overview
--------
Forecasting in the memories-dev framework involves predicting future values based on historical data patterns. This capability is essential for anticipating environmental changes, resource demands, and system behaviors.

Methods
-------

ARIMA Models
~~~~~~~~~~
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models.

.. math::

   \phi(B)(1-B)^d y_t = \theta(B)\epsilon_t

where:
- \(\phi(B)\) is the AR operator
- \(\theta(B)\) is the MA operator
- \(B\) is the backshift operator
- \(d\) is the differencing order

Prophet Model
~~~~~~~~~~~
Decomposable time series model.

.. math::

   y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t

where:
- \(g(t)\) is the trend function
- \(s(t)\) is the seasonal component
- \(h(t)\) is the holiday component
- \(\epsilon_t\) is the error term

Implementation
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.forecasting import Forecaster
    
    # Initialize forecaster
    forecaster = Forecaster(
        model="prophet",  # or "arima", "lstm"
        seasonality_mode="multiplicative",
        uncertainty_samples=1000
    )
    
    # Generate forecast
    forecast = await forecaster.predict(
        historical_data=data,
        horizon=30,  # days
        frequency="D",
        include_history=True
    )

Deep Learning Methods
------------------

LSTM Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~
Long Short-Term Memory networks for complex patterns.

.. math::

   f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)

where:
- \(f_t\) is the forget gate
- \(W_f\) is the weight matrix
- \(h_{t-1}\) is the previous hidden state
- \(x_t\) is the input
- \(b_f\) is the bias
