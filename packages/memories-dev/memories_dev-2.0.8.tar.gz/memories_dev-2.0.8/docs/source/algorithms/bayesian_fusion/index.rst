Bayesian Fusion
===================

.. note::
   This documentation is under development. More detailed content will be added in future releases.

Overview
--------

Bayesian fusion is a statistical approach for combining multiple sources of information or data, taking into account the uncertainty in each source. In the context of Earth memory systems, Bayesian fusion allows for the integration of diverse data streams with varying levels of reliability and uncertainty.

Theory and Implementation
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Example Bayesian fusion implementation
   def bayesian_fusion(prior_distribution, likelihood_functions, observations):
       """
       Perform Bayesian fusion of multiple data sources
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       prior_distribution : dict
           The prior probability distribution
       likelihood_functions : list
           List of likelihood functions for each data source
       observations : list
           List of observations from each data source
           
       Returns:
       --------
       dict
           The posterior probability distribution
       """
       posterior = prior_distribution.copy()
       
       # Apply each likelihood function sequentially
       for i, (likelihood, observation) in enumerate(zip(likelihood_functions, observations)):
           posterior = update_posterior(posterior, likelihood, observation)
           
       return posterior

Key Applications
---------------

* **Multi-sensor Data Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors with different error characteristics and spatial/temporal resolutions
* **Uncertainty Propagation**: Tracking how uncertainty evolves through the fusion process
* **Handling Missing Data**: Gracefully incorporating information when some data sources have gaps
* **Adaptive Weighting**: Automatically adjusting the influence of each data source based on reliability
* **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying data points that are inconsistent with the integrated model

Examples
--------

Common applications in Memories-Dev include:

* Fusing satellite imagery with ground-based sensor networks
* Combining historical records with real-time observations
* Integrating climate model outputs with empirical measurements
* Merging qualitative observations with quantitative data

Coming Soon
----------

Future documentation will include:

* Step-by-step tutorials for implementing Bayesian fusion
* Case studies demonstrating real-world applications
* Advanced techniques for complex, high-dimensional data
* Performance optimization guidelines
