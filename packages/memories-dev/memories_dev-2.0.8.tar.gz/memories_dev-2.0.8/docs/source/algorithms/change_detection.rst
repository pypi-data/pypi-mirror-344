Change Detection
==================

Overview
--------
Change detection is a critical component of the memories-dev framework, enabling the identification and analysis of changes in spatial and temporal data. This process is essential for monitoring environmental changes, urban development, and other dynamic phenomena.

Methods
-------

Image Differencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basic method comparing two temporal states.

.. math::

   D(x,y) = I_2(x,y) - I_1(x,y)

where:
- \(D(x,y)\) is the difference image
- \(I_1(x,y)\) and \(I_2(x,y)\) are images at times t1 and t2

Change Vector Analysis (CVA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Multi-dimensional change detection.

.. math::

   \|\Delta\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_{2i} - v_{1i})^2}

where:
- \(\|\Delta\vec{v}\|\) is the magnitude of change
- \(v_{1i}\) and \(v_{2i}\) are feature values at times t1 and t2

Implementation
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from memories.analysis import ChangeDetector
    
    # Initialize detector
    detector = ChangeDetector(
        method="cva",  # or "difference"
        threshold=0.15,
        temporal_window=30  # days
    )
    
    # Perform detection
    changes = await detector.detect(
        data_t1=state1,
        data_t2=state2,
        features=["ndvi", "urban", "water"],
        uncertainty=True
    )

Statistical Methods
-----------------

Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~
Determining significant changes using statistical thresholds.

.. math::

   T = \mu \pm k\sigma

where:
- \(T\) is the threshold
- \(\mu\) is the mean difference
- \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation
- \(k\) is a scaling factor

Change Probability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Probabilistic approach to change detection.

.. math::

   P(change|x) = \frac{P(x|change)P(change)}{P(x)}

Applications
-----------
1. Land use change monitoring
2. Urban growth analysis
3. Deforestation tracking
4. Disaster impact assessment
5. Agricultural monitoring

Best Practices
-------------
1. Pre-processing data normalization
2. Accounting for seasonal variations
3. Validating with ground truth
4. Using multiple detection methods
5. Considering spatial context

Validation
---------
1. Accuracy assessment
2. Confusion matrix analysis
3. ROC curve evaluation
4. Cross-validation
5. Field verification
