Feature Fusion
===================

.. note::
   This documentation is under development. More detailed content will be added in future releases.

Overview
--------

Feature fusion is a technique for combining features extracted from multiple data sources or modalities into a single, unified representation. In Earth memory systems, feature fusion enables the creation of rich, multi-dimensional feature spaces that capture complementary information from diverse sensors and data streams.

Implementation Approaches
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Example feature fusion implementation
   def feature_fusion(feature_sets, fusion_method='concatenation', weights=None):
       """
       Fuse multiple feature sets into a unified representation
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       feature_sets : list
           List of feature arrays from different sources [n_samples, n_features_i]
       fusion_method : str
           Method to use for fusion: 'concatenation', 'averaging', or 'weighted'
       weights : list, optional
           Weights for each feature set if using 'weighted' method
           
       Returns:
       --------
       numpy.ndarray
           Fused feature representation
       """
       if fusion_method == 'concatenation':
           # Simple concatenation of feature vectors
           return np.concatenate(feature_sets, axis=1)
           
       elif fusion_method == 'averaging':
           # Normalize and average features
           normalized_features = [normalize(f) for f in feature_sets]
           return np.mean(normalized_features, axis=0)
           
       elif fusion_method == 'weighted':
           # Weighted combination of features
           if weights is None:
               weights = [1.0/len(feature_sets)] * len(feature_sets)
           
           normalized_features = [normalize(f) for f in feature_sets]
           weighted_features = [w * f for w, f in zip(weights, normalized_features)]
           return np.sum(weighted_features, axis=0)

Key Techniques
-------------

* **Early Fusion**: Combining raw or minimally processed features before analysis
* **Late Fusion**: Combining features after initial processing or modeling
* **Hierarchical Fusion**: Multi-level fusion combining both early and late approaches
* **Cross-modal Embedding**: Projecting features from different modalities into a shared latent space
* **Attention-based Fusion**: Using attention mechanisms to dynamically weight feature importance

Applications
-----------

* Combining spectral and spatial features from remote sensing data
* Integrating environmental sensor readings with contextual metadata
* Fusing text descriptions with numerical measurements
* Combining features across different temporal and spatial scales

Coming Soon
----------

Future documentation will include:

* Detailed tutorials on implementing different fusion techniques
* Best practices for feature normalization and alignment
* Case studies demonstrating fusion benefits for specific applications
* Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
