# Scan Stubs - The building blocks of a scan
In order to simplify the creation of new scans, BEC provides a set of scan stubs that can be used as building blocks for new scans. The scan stubs are located in `bec_server/bec_server/scan_server/scan_stubs.py`. The following scan stubs are available:

*Device operations*

- [`set`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.set) Set a device or a list of devices to the given value.
- [`read`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.read) Read a device and wait for it to finish.
- [`stage`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.stage) Stage all devices.
- [`unstage`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.unstage) Unstage all devices.
- [`kickoff`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.kickoff) Kickoff a device. Usually only needed for fly scans.
- [`complete`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.complete) Wait for a device to finish a long-running operation. Typically used after `kickoff`.
- [`pre_scan`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.pre_scan) Trigger the pre_scan method of a device.
- [`baseline_reading`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.baseline_reading) Trigger the baseline readings. 
- [`trigger`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.trigger) Send a trigger to all devices that have `softwareTrigger` set to `True`.
- [`send_rpc`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.send_rpc) Send an RPC command to a device.
- [`send_rpc_and_wait`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.send_rpc_and_wait) Send an RPC command to a device and wait for it to finish. The return value is the response of the RPC command.


*Scan operations*
- [`open_scan`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.open_scan) Open a scan.
- [`close_scan`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.close_scan) Close a scan. 
- [`publish_data_as_read`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.publish_data_as_read) Publish data as read.
- [`open_scan_def`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.open_scan_def) Open a scan definition. 
- [`close_scan_def`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.close_scan_def) Close a scan definition. 
- [`scan_report_instruction`](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.scan_report_instruction) Update the scan report instruction.

More information on the scan stubs can be found in the [API reference](/api_reference/_autosummary/bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs.rst#bec_server.scan_server.scan_stubs.ScanStubs).


## Blocking and non-blocking usage
The device scan stubs can be used in a blocking or non-blocking way. The blocking way is the default and is used when the `wait` parameter is set to `True`. In this case, the scan stub will wait for the device to finish the operation before continuing. The non-blocking operation is used when the `wait` parameter is set to `False`. In this case, the scan stub will start the operation and continue immediately without waiting for the device to finish. The non-blocking mode is useful when you want to interact with multiple devices at the same time.

To use the scan stubs in an non-blocking way, you can use the returned `ScanStubStatus` object to later wait for the operation to finish. 

The following example demonstrates how a blocking and non-blocking operation can be used:

```python
# Blocking operation: Set the device to the value 10 and wait for it to finish
def my_func(self):
    yield from self.set(device=self.my_motor, value=10)

# Non-blocking operation: Set the device to the value 10 and continue immediately
def my_func_async(self):
    status = yield from self.set(device=self.my_motor, value=10, wait=False)
    # Do something else
    status.wait()
```


Especially for fly scans, the non-blocking way is useful as it allows you to start your flyer and in the meantime do other operations.

```python
def fly_scan_core(self):
    # kickoff the device
    yield from self.kickoff(device=self.my_flyer)

    # run the complete method of the device
    status = yield from self.complete(device=self.my_flyer, wait=False)

    while not status.done:
        # Do other operations, e.g. read all 'monitored' devices at 1 Hz
        yield from self.read(group="monitored", point_id=self.point_id)
        self.point_id += 1

```
