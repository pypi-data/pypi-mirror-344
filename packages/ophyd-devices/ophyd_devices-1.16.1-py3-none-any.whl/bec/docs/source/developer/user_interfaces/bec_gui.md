Real-time plotting and data visualization play a crucial role in making sense of the data being collected. To facilitate this, BEC provides a live plotting interface through BEC Widgets. This toolkit takes advantage of BEC's architecture to offer advanced features and a seamless level of integration that surpasses what can be achieved with direct use of libraries such as matplotlib. BEC Widgets is designed to streamline the process of visualizing data in real-time, making it easier for users to interact with and interpret their data dynamically. Detailed documentation for both using and developing components within BEC Widgets is available [here](https://bec-widgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), offering guidance and insights to help users fully leverage the toolkit's capabilities.
