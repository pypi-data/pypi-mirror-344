scan_id 
    The ``scan_id`` is the unique identifier for a scan. It is a string, typically uuid4, that is generated automatically by the scan server. It is used to uniquely identify a scan, even across multiple experiments and beamlines.
scan_number
    The ``scan_number`` is an integer that is assigned to a scan by the scan server. It can be used to identify a scan within an experiment but is typically reset to 1 for each new experiment. The ``scan_number`` is also used by the file_writer to name the files that are generated by a scan.
dataset_number
    The ``dataset_number`` is an integer that is assigned to a dataset by the scan server. It is used to group scans into larger, logical units. The ``dataset_number`` is typically reset to 1 for each new experiment.
request_id
    The ``request_id`` is an identifier for a request to the scan server. As of now, it is a uuid4 string that is generated by the bec_lib during the preparation of a new request. A scan can comprise instructions from multiple requests.
queue_id
    The ``queue_id`` is an identifier for an element in a queue. Each queue element can contain multiple scans and thus enforce the sequential execution of those scans. The ``queue_id`` is a uuid4 string that is generated by the bec_lib during the preparation of a new queue element.
DIID
    The ``DIID`` is the device instruction ID. It is a continuously increasing integer that is assigned to each device instruction in a scan. The ``DIID`` is used to uniquely identify each device instruction and its response in the scan. 
point_id
    The ``point_id`` is an integer that is assigned to each point in a scan. It is used to uniquely identify each point in a scan and is used to group the data that is generated by a scan. The ``point_id`` is typically set directly during the scan definition and used by the {term}`Scan Bundler` to logically bundle the data that is generated by a scan. In synchronous fly scans, the ``point_id may`` also be set directly by the device. 
Device Server
    The Device Server provides a core service of BEC and handles the communication to the devices. It is the only process that actually holds the connection to the devices. Other services, like the {term}`Scan Server`, communicate with the Device Server to interact with the devices.
Scan Server
    The Scan Server provides a core service of BEC and handles the execution of scans. It is responsible for receiving and validating scan requests, assembling the scan instructions, queueing the scan and finally executing the scan using a Scan Worker. If necessary, the Scan Server emits DeviceInstructionMessages to the {term}`Device Server` to interact with the devices. 
Scan Bundler
    The Scan Bundler is a core service of BEC that is responsible for bundling the data that is generated by a scan. It subscribes to Redis channels and listens for data that is generated by the devices. The Scan Bundler then bundles the data into logical units, called scan segments, and emits them as ScanMessage back to Redis.
File Writer
    The File Writer is a core service of BEC that is responsible for writing HDF5 files with Nexus-compatible metadata and data entries to disk. It receives its data from the {term}`Scan Bundler`, and also adds external links to files written by other services, such as data backends for large 2D detector data. The internal structure of the files can be adjusted to the beamlineâ€™s needs using customizable plugins to comply with the desired [NeXus application definition](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/index.html).
