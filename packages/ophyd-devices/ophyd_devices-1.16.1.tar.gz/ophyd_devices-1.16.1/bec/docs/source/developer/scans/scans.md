# Scans
BEC uses scans to orchestrate the data acquisition. While script-based scans can also be defined in the command-line interface, acquisitions that require more complex orchestration should be defined as scan plugins for the BEC scan server. This section describes the basic structure of a scan and how to create a scan plugin.
