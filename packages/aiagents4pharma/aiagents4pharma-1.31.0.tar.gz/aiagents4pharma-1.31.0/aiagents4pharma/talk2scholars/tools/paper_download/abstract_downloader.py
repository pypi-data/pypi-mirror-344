Abstract Base Class for Paper Downloaders.

This module defines the `AbstractPaperDownloader` class, which serves as a
base class for downloading scholarly papers from different sources
(e.g., arXiv, PubMed, IEEE Xplore). Any specific downloader should
inherit from this class and implement its methods.
