"""
A Featurizer is a structure that takes a set of trajectories and returns a
feature matrix. The feature matrix is a 2D numpy array with shape (n_trajs,
n_features).

This module contains the basic structures for creating featurizers along
with the implementation of some of them which compute the most common
features used in the literature.
