    {% call details(_("What data are you storing about me?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    The data we store are:
    <ul>
      <li>the PDF files you upload (in RAM only; see next question);</li>
      <li>anonymous daily statistics (such as <em>today, XXX files have been processed using layout XXX, totalizing XXX Mb.</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    That's all. Nothing more.
    {%- endtrans %}
    {% endcall %}
    {% call details(_("So you don't use cookies?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    We do use cookies, but not to track you. The cookies are only used to remember your prefered language, if set by choosing it in the top menu.

    {% call details(_("Who have access to the files I upload here?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    <ul>
      <li>Short answer: Do not upload here anything you would not want to be public. </li>
      <li>Long answer: Nobody will look to the files you upload. However:
      <ul>
        <li>technically, I (the author and maintainer of this website) have access to everything you upload (but I won't bother reading it); </li>
        <li>although I did my best, there might be security issues, and your files might be publicly accessible without my knowledge;</li>
        <li>malicious hackers might try and gain access to the server.</li>
      </ul>
      If you are not happy with it, you can use this software locally (see next question).
      </li>
    </ul>

    {% endcall %}
    {% call details(_("How can I use this tool locally?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    You can either:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://framagit.org/spalax/pdfimpose-web">install this webserver locally</a> and run it from your computer;</li>
      <li>locally install the underlying tools (<a href="https://framagit.org/spalax/pdfimpose">pdfimpose</a> and <a href="https://framagit.org/spalax/pdfautonup">pdfautonup</a>). However, as far as I know, no one bothered to build a graphical user interface to them, so you will need to know a bit of command line to use them.</li>
    </ul>
    Both solutions require a bit of technical knowledge…

    {% call details(_("I found a bug. How do I report it?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    You can either open an issue on <a href="https://framagit.org/spalax/pdfimpose-web/-/issues">Framagit</a> or send me an email: <a href="mailto:contact(at)pdfimpose(dot)it">contact(at)pdfimpose(dot)it</a>.

    {% call details(_("And if I don't speak English?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    French-speaking users can contact us at the very same address: <a href="mailto:contact(at)pdfimpose(dot)it">contact(at)pdfimpose(dot)it</a>. Other languages? Sorry…
    {%- endtrans %}
    {% endcall %}
    {% call details(_("I have an idea to improve the user experience: we might just…")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    <ul>
      <li>Short answer: NO!</li>
      <li>Long answer: I suck at designing easy-to-use applications. I spent ages coding this website, and I would spend hours to implement a tiny improvement. So I probably won't do it. However, if <em>you</em> can do it, I will be happy to merge your pull-request.</li>
    </ul>
    {%- endtrans %}
    {% endcall %}
    {% call details(_("Images are barely readable. Wouldn't videos be far more explanatories to explain the different layouts?")) %}
    {% trans -%}
    I wholly agree. But if I were to make them, I would spend hours for deplorable results. But I will be happy to include your videos!
