"""
Module containing scatter matrix calculations and the Scatter class.

This module provides various functions to compute scatter matrices, which are essential for the
ICS algorithm. The scatter matrices implemented include the
covariance matrix, weighted covariance matrix, and the one-step Tyler shape matrix. These
scatter matrices are encapsulated in the Scatter class, which includes information about
the location (mean) and a label describing the type of scatter matrix. If you want to use ICS with other scatter
matrices than the ones provided in this module, you would need to create Scatter object. The S1 and S2 arguments are
functions returning Scatter objects.

Most scatters come from the `R package ICS <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICS/index.html>`_.
