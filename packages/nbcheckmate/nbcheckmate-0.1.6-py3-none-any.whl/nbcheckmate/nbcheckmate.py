This module provides functionality for managing and testing functions
and variables from Jupyter notebooks using pytest and dill.

Classes:
    - ResultsTests: A class to save, load, and run tests for variables and functions,
      with support for running pytest and generating result messages.

Dependencies:
    - dill: Used for pickling and unpickling test data.
    - subprocess: Used to execute pytest and capture the test results.
