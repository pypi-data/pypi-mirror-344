' COMMENTS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION:
' 1) Background and Alternative
'    This function was intended to be written as a single procedure without any
'    dependencies, for maximum portability between projects, as it implements a
'    functionality that is very commonly needed for many VBA applications
'    working inside OneDrive/SharePoint synchronized directories. I followed
'    this paradigm because it was not clear to me how complicated this simple
'    sounding endeavour would turn out to be.
'    Unfortunately, more and more complications arose, and little by little,
'    the procedure turned incredibly complicated. I do not condone the coding
'    style applied here, and that this is not how I usually write code,
'    nevertheless, I'm not open to rewriting this code in a different style,
'    because a clean implementation of this algorithm already exists, as pointed
'    out in the following.
'
'    If you would like to understand the underlying algorithm of how the local
'    path can be found with only the Url-path as input, I recommend following
'    the much cleaner implementation by Cristian Buse:
'    https://github.com/cristianbuse/VBA-FileTools
'    We developed the algorithm together and wrote separate implementations
'    concurrently. His solution is contained inside a module-level library,
'    split into many procedures and using features like private types and API-
'    functions, that are not available when trying to create a single procedure
'    without dependencies like below. This makes his code more readable.
'
'    Both of our solutions are well tested and actively supported with bugfixes
'    and improvements, so both should be equally valid choices for use in your
'    project. The differences in performance/features are marginal and they can
'    often be used interchangeably. If you need more file-system interaction
'    functionality, use Cristians library, and if you only need GetLocalPath,
'    just copy this function to any module in your project and it will work.
'
' 2) How does this function NOT work?
'    Most other solutions for this problem circulating online (A list of most
'    can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73577057/12287457) are using
'    one of two approaches, :
'     1. they use the environment variables set by OneDrive:
'         - Environ(OneDrive)
'         - Environ(OneDriveCommercial)
'         - Environ(OneDriveConsumer)
'        and replace part of the URL with it. There are many problems with this
'        approach:
'         1. They are not being set by OneDrive on MacOS.
'         2. It is unclear exactly which part of the URL needs to be replaced.
'         3. Environment variables can be changed by the user.
'         4. Only there three exist. If more onedrive accounts are logged in,
'            they just overwrite the previous ones.
'        or,
'     2. they use the mount points OneDrive writes to the registry here:
'         - \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SyncEngines\Providers\OneDrive\
'        this also has several drawbacks:
'         1. The registry is not available on MacOS.
'         2. It's still unclear exactly what part of the URL should be replaced.
'         3. These registry keys can contain mistakes, like for example, when:
'             - Synchronizing a folder called "Personal" from someone else's
'               personal OneDrive
'             - Synchronizing a folder called "Business1" from someone else's
'               personal OneDrive and then relogging your own first Business
'               OneDrive account
'             - Relogging you personal OneDrive can change the "CID" property
'               from a folderID formatted cid (e.g. 3DEA8A9886F05935!125) to a
'               regular private cid (e.g. 3dea8a9886f05935) for synced folders
'               from other people's OneDrives
'
'    For these reasons, this solution uses a completely different approach to
'    solve this problem.
'
' 3) How does this function work?
'    This function builds the Web to Local translation dictionary by extracting
'    the mount points from the OneDrive settings files.
'    It reads files from...
'    On Windows:
'        - the "...\AppData\Local\Microsoft" directory
'    On Mac:
'        - the "~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/" & _
'              "Library/Application Support" directory
'        - and/or the "~/Library/Application Support"
'    It reads the following files:
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Personal\ClientPolicy.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Personal\????????????????.dat
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Personal\????????????????.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Personal\global.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Personal\GroupFolders.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Business#\????????-????-????-????-????????????.dat
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Business#\????????-????-????-????-????????????.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Business#\ClientPolicy*.ini
'      - \OneDrive\settings\Business#\global.ini
'      - \Office\CLP\* (just the filename)
'
'    Where:
'     - "*" ... 0 or more characters
'     - "?" ... one character [0-9, a-f]
'     - "#" ... one digit
'     - "\" ... path separator, (= "/" on MacOS)
'     - The "???..." filenames represent CIDs)
'
'    On MacOS, the \Office\CLP\* exists for each Microsoft Office application
'    separately. Depending on whether the application was already used in
'    active syncing with OneDrive it may contain different/incomplete files.
'    In the code, the path of this directory is stored inside the variable
'    "clpPath". On MacOS, the defined clpPath might not exist or not contain
'    all necessary files for some host applications, because Environ("HOME")
'    depends on the host app.
'    This is not a big problem as the function will still work, however in
'    this case, specifying a preferredMountPointOwner will do nothing.
'    To make sure this directory and the necessary files exist, a file must
'    have been actively synchronized with OneDrive by the application whose
'    "HOME" folder is returned by Environ("HOME") while being logged in
'    to that application with the account whose email is given as
'    preferredMountPointOwner, at some point in the past!
'
'    If you are usually working with Excel but are using this function in a
'    different app, you can instead use an alternative (Excels CLP folder) as
'    the clpPath as it will most likely contain all the necessary information
'    The alternative clpPath is commented out in the code, if you prefer to
'    use Excels CLP folder per default, just un-comment the respective line
'    in the code.
'*******************************************************************************

'*******************************************************************************
' COMMENTS REGARDING THE USAGE:
' This function can be used as a User Defined Function (UDF) from the worksheet.
' (More on that, see "USAGE EXAMPLES")
'
' This function offers three optional parameters to the user, however using
' these should only be necessary in extremely rare situations.
' The best rule regarding their usage: Don't use them.
'
' In the following these parameters will still be explained.
'
'1) returnAll
'   In some exceptional cases it is possible to map one OneDrive WebPath to
'   multiple different localPaths. This can happen when multiple Business
'   OneDrive accounts are logged in on one device, and multiple of these have
'   access to the same OneDrive folder and they both decide to synchronize it or
'   add it as link to their MySite library.
'   Calling the function with returnAll:=True will return all valid localPaths
'   for the given WebPath, separated by two forward slashes (//). This should be
'   used with caution, as the return value of the function alone is, should
'   multiple local paths exist for the input webPath, not a valid local path
'   anymore.
'   An example of how to obtain all of the local paths could look like this:
'   Dim localPath as String, localPaths() as String
'   localPath = GetLocalPath(webPath, True)
'   If Not localPath Like "http*" Then
'       localPaths = Split(localPath, "//")
'   End If
'
'2) preferredMountPointOwner
'   This parameter deals with the same problem as 'returnAll'
'   If the function gets called with returnAll:=False (default), and multiple
'   localPaths exist for the given WebPath, the function will just return any
'   one of them, as usually, it shouldn't make a difference, because the result
'   directories at both of these localPaths are mirrored versions of the same
'   webPath. Nevertheless, this option lets the user choose, which mountPoint
'   should be chosen if multiple localPaths are available. Each localPath is
'  'owned' by an OneDrive Account. If a WebPath is synchronized twice, this can
'   only happen by synchronizing it with two different accounts, because
'   OneDrive prevents you from synchronizing the same folder twice on a single
'   account. Therefore, each of the different localPaths for a given WebPath
'   has a unique 'owner'. preferredMountPointOwner lets the user select the
'   localPath by specifying the account the localPath should be owned by.
'   This is done by passing the Email address of the desired account as
'   preferredMountPointOwner.
'   For example, you have two different Business OneDrive accounts logged in,
'   foo.bar@business1.com and foo.bar@business2.com
'   Both synchronize the WebPath:
'   webPath = "https://business1.sharepoint.com/sites/TestLib/Documents/" & _
              "Test/Test/Test/test.xlsm"
'
'   The first one has added it as a link to his personal OneDrive, the local
'   path looks like this:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'
'   The second one just synchronized it normally, the localPath looks like this:
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
'
'   Calling GetLocalPath like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,,, "foo.bar@business1.com") will return:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'
'   Calling it like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,,, "foo.bar@business2.com") will return:
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
'
'   And calling it like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,, True) will return:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm//C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\...
'   ...test.xlsm
'
'   Calling it normally like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath) will return any one of the two localPaths, so:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'   OR
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
'
'3) rebuildCache
'   The function creates a "translation" dictionary from the OneDrive settings
'   files and then uses this dictionary to "translate" WebPaths to LocalPaths.
'   This dictionary is implemented as a static variable to the function doesn't
'   have to recreate it every time it is called. It is written on the first
'   function call and reused on all the subsequent calls, making them faster.
'   If the function is called with rebuildCache:=True, this dictionary will be
'   rewritten, even if it was already initialized.
'   Note that it is not necessary to use this parameter manually, even if a new
'   MountPoint was added to the OneDrive, or a new OneDrive account was logged
'   in since the last function call because the function will automatically
'   determine if any of those cases occurred, without sacrificing performance.
