description: >
  MitoNet_v1_mini was trained on the large CEM-MitoLab dataset and is a generalist
  for mitochondrial segmentation. The underlying architecture is PanopticBiFPN,
  which is very parameter efficient and trains and predicts slightly faster than
  the full MitoNet model. Read the preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.17.484806
