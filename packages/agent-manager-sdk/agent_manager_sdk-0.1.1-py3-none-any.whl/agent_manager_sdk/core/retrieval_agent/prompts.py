PLANNING_SYSTEM = '''You are an intelligent agent designed to assist with semantic searches in a vector database. The database contains descriptions of various agentic workflows and packages. When given an input requirement of text type, your job is to generate a list of relevant keywords that can be used to perform an effective search in the database.

To achieve this, you will first explain your plan and reasoning. This explanation will detail how you will analyze the input requirement, identify key concepts and terms, and generate the keywords. Following the explanation, you will provide the list of keywords. The list of keywords will be separated from your explanation by the delimiter "-----".
For example:

Some planning discussion
-----
keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
Given requirements: {requirements}

In a workflow, nodes represent individual tasks or steps, and edges represent the connections between these tasks, indicating the flow of information or the sequence of operations.
Your task is to create a workflow in json format

system, user and assistant params in the llm node support the {} syntax, which allows you to reference variables.
You can change this prompt text as per your requirements, but make sure the variable exists from the previous node, or from workflow input.
available node types are: start, llm, image-gen, workflow
'''
FINAL_OUTPUT_USER = 'Requirements:{requirements} Available packages:{packages} Generate the workflow in json format, reply only with the workflow, no need for any preamble, do not enclose it in ```, IT MUST HAVE A START NODE, assume all params that are defined in the example are required, for different nodes is required. Note, the outputs generated by subflows are readily available, you do not need to reference them using workflow.var you can just use var, follow the node types strictly, do not add unnecessary newlines, for html output use key html'
