"""
This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) function to list issues from a Jira project using the JiraClient.

The `cli_list_issues` function retrieves issues based on various filters such as project, component, reporter, and
assignee. It processes the retrieved issues to format and print them in a user-friendly manner, allowing for dynamic
column selection and sorting.

Key functionalities include:
- Fetching issues from Jira based on specified criteria.
- Flattening issue fields for easier processing.
- Dynamically generating headers based on user-defined view columns or defaults.
- Filtering and sorting issues based on user input.
- Handling errors related to issue listing gracefully.

Dependencies:
- `core.columns`: Provides utility functions for manipulating issue data.
- `core.env_fetcher`: Fetches environment-specific configurations.
- `exceptions.exceptions`: Custom exception handling for issue listing errors.
- `rest.client`: Contains the JiraClient for interacting with the Jira API.
