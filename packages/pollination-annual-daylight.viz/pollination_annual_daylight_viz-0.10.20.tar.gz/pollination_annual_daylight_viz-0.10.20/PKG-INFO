# annual-daylight
Annual daylight recipe for Pollination.

Use this recipe to calculate annual daylight for a HBJSON model.

This recipe uses a 2-phase method for daylight simulation. If the accuracy of the direct sunlight is important, you can use the [annual-daylight-enhanced](https://github.com/pollination/annual-daylight-enhanced) recipe.

### Versions
There are three different versions of the recipe. All three versions use the same simulation methodology and workflow, although their outputs vary.
