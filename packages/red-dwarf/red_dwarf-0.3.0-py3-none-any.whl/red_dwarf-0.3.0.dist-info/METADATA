A <em>DIM</em>ensional <em>RED</em>uction library for [stellarpunk][] democracy into the long haul.

> Stars are fires that burn for thousands of years. Some of them burn slow and
> long, like red dwarfs. Others-blue giants-burn their fuel so fast they shine
> across great distances, and are easy to see. As they start to run out of
> fuel, they burn helium, grow even hotter, and explode in a supernova.
> Supernovas, they're brighter than the brightest galaxies. They die, and
> everyone watches them go. -- Jodi Picoult, My Sister's Keeper

> If advanced alien civilizations really are out there, the planets of red
> dwarf stars could be ideal places to find them. -- [How the Universe Works

## Roadmap

For now, see [this related issue](https://github.com/patcon/red-dwarf/issues/4)

## Goals

Code that aspires to embody and support democratic values should be...

- **Legible.** It should be explorable and auditable not just to researchers, but to as many curious citizens as possible.
- **Re-usable.** It should be easily used in contexts in which its original creators did not anticipate, nor perhaps even desire.
- **Collectively stewarded.** It should grow and govern itself democratically and in a plural fashion.
