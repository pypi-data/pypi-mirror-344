# ðŸ”§ bvhTools ðŸ”§
**bvhTools** is a Python library to work with BVH (Biovision Hierarchy) files. It enables to load, modify and write BVH files in very few lines of code. This project is being developed in the context of a phD, so the library contains many BVH operations that I need to make often.

Curently, this library is a work in progress, but it already has many functionalities that you can use.

# ðŸŒŸ Functionalities
- Reading and writing BVH files
- Performing Forward Kinematics
- Manipulating BVH files (moving and rotating skeletons)
- BVH Slicing (partitioning and putting together motion data)
- BVH viewing using matplotlib
- Writing data to CSV files (world positions or  local positions + rotations)

# ðŸ§° Installation (WIP)
Currently, this library has to be cloned from github, and use the classes as they are. However, in the future it will be installed as a pip package.
