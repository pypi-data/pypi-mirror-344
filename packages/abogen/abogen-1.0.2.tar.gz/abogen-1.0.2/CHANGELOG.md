- Fixed the issue with some chapters in EPUB files had missing content.
- Fixed the issue with some EPUB files only having one chapter caused the program to ignore the entire book.
- Fixed "utf-8' codec can't decode byte" error, mentioned by @nigelp in #3
- Added "Replace single newlines with spaces" option in the menu. This can be useful for texts that have imaginary line breaks.
