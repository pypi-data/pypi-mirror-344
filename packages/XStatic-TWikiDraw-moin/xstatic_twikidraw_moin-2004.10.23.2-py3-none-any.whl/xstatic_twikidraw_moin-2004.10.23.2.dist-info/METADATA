XStatic-TWikiDraw-moin
----------------------

TWikiDraw-moin java library packaged for setuptools (easy_install) / pip.

This is a modified version from `TWikiDrawPlugin of 29 Jan 2003 - 21:47 <http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/TWikiDrawPlugin>`_ 
adding:

 - basename argument
 - indexed PNG support
 - deprecated name attribute of the <map> tag replaced by the id attribute
 - corrects object stacking order for the map

This package is intended to be used by **any** project that needs these files.

It intentionally does **not** provide any extra code except some metadata
**nor** has any extra requirements. You MAY use some minimal support code from
the XStatic base package, if you like.

You can find more info about the xstatic packaging way in the package `XStatic`.
