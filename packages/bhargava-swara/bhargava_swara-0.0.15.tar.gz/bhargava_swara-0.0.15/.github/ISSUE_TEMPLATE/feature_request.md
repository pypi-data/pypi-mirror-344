   - Inside `.github/`, create an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder for the issue templates.

2. **Add the Files**:
   - Copy and paste the content of each template into the respective files:
     - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
     - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
     - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`
     - `.github/pull_request_template.md`

3. **Commit and Push**:
   - Add these files to your repository, commit them, and push to GitHub.
   ```bash

4. **Verify**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
