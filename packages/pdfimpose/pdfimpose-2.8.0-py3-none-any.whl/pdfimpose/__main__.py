        - omargin (margin on output files): Your printer is not perfect, and probably cannot print on the very edge of the sheet of paper. You might need to add some margin, so that everything is printed.
        - imargin (margin on input files): Your scissors are not perfect. You might need to add some margin, so that you can cut exactly between two (input) pages.
        - creep: Your paper is not perfect. When folded, the inner pages will go farther than the outer pages. Use creep to fix this.

        You might want to set omargin as half of imargin, so that your printed sheets can be folded exactly in half.
