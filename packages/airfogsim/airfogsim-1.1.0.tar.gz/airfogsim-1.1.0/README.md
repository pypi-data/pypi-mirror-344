## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

AirFogSim is built around an event-driven Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) architecture that enables efficient simulation of complex interactions between heterogeneous agents. The platform extends the SimPy discrete-event simulation library, providing specialized components for UAV-integrated fog computing scenarios.

### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture of AirFogSim is designed with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and performance. It consists of several key components:

#### 1. Simulation Environment (Environment)

The central hub of the simulation, extending SimPy's Environment for discrete-event scheduling:
- **Event Registry (EventRegistry):** Central bus for publishing and subscribing to named events across all simulation entities, enabling decoupled communication.
- **Airspace Manager (AirspaceManager):** Octree-based spatial management for position and collision information.
- **Landing Manager (LandingManager):** Management of landing spots and charging stations.
- **Frequency Manager (FrequencyManager):** Management of spectrum resources with 3GPP-compliant channel models.
- **Contract Manager (ContractManager):** Management of contracts and transactions.
- **Workflow Manager (WorkflowManager):** Management of workflow lifecycles.
- **Task Manager (TaskManager):** Management of task creation and execution.
- **Data Provider (DataProvider):** Provision of real-time data and statistics, including weather and traffic flow.

#### 2. Agent (Agent)

Autonomous decision-making entities like UAVs and ground stations:
- **State Management:** Maintains internal state with type validation through metaclass-based state templates.
- **Decision Logic:** SimPy process defining the agent's behavior loop, perceiving state, workflows, and events to decide which tasks to execute.
- **Component Ownership:** Owns components representing its capabilities (mobility, sensing, computation).
- **Task Initiation:** Initiates tasks by delegating execution to appropriate components.
- **Event Handling:** Triggers and subscribes to events for state changes, task lifecycle, and object possession.

#### 3. Component (Component)

Abstracts specific capabilities (mobility, computation, charging) and provides the execution environment for tasks:
- **Task Execution:** Manages task lifecycle, resource acquisition, metrics calculation, and cleanup.
- **Resource Interaction:** Defines resource requirements and requests resources from appropriate managers.
- **Metrics Calculation:** Calculates performance metrics based on resource attributes and agent state.
- **Event Emission:** Triggers namespaced events for task status and metric changes.

#### 4. Task (Task)

Encapsulates the logic for specific actions, defining how work is performed:
- **Execution Logic:** SimPy generator consuming performance metrics provided by components.
- **Metric Consumption:** Declares necessary metrics required from executing components.
- **State Production:** Updates agent state based on task logic and progress.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Manages task status (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED).

#### 5. Workflow (Workflow) & State Machine (WorkflowStatusMachine)

Represents higher-level goals or processes, acting as a monitor and coordinator:
- **State Machine:** Contains a WorkflowStatusMachine instance managing internal states and transitions.
- **Trigger-Driven Transitions:** Uses triggers to define rules based on agent state, events, or time.
- **Context/Guidance:** Provides workflow context and suggests next tasks for agents based on current state.

#### 6. Trigger (Trigger)

Monitors specific simulation conditions and executes callbacks when met:
- **Condition Monitoring:** Checks for event occurrences, agent state changes, or time passage.
- **Activation/Deactivation:** Can be activated to monitor and deactivated to stop.
- **Types:** EventTrigger, StateTrigger, TimeTrigger, and CompositeTrigger for different monitoring needs.

#### 7. Resource Layer (Resource & ResourceManager)

Models entities that are utilized or consumed:
- **Resource Base Class:** Defines common properties like id, attributes, and status.
- **ResourceManager Base Class:** Generic base for managing resources of specific types.
- **Specific Managers:** Implement resource-specific logic for finding, allocation, release, and modeling contention.

### Visualization System

AirFogSim integrates a complete visualization system, including:

- **Dashboard:** Displays simulation status, agent information, and system events
- **UAV Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of UAV positions, states, and trajectories
- **Workflow Configuration:** Configuration and monitoring of workflow execution
- **Data Analysis:** Resource usage and performance metrics analysis

### Best Practices for Developing New Classes

Before developing new agent, component, task, or workflow classes, we recommend using the helper module's class checker tools to see if there are already classes that meet your requirements, avoiding duplicate creation.

```bash
# Check all classes in the system
python -m airfogsim.helper.class_finder --all

# Find agent classes supporting specific states
python -m airfogsim.helper.class_finder --find-agent position,battery_level
```

Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Use the helper module to check existing classes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Create a Pull Request
