- The API version should now be omitted from the API_HOST setting (e.g.
  https://api.3di.live instead of https://api.3di.live/v3.0). A warning will be emitted if
  a version is included.

- Make V3AlphaApi a subclass of V3BetaApi, and V3BetaApi a superset of V3Api.

- Added a ``retries`` to the ``ThreediApi`` which enables setting a retry policy.
  For the async client, ``aiohttp_retry`` is included.

- Changed the default ``timeout`` of asynchronous file down/upload from 5 minutes total to
  only socket timeouts of 5 seconds. This allows upload of larger files.
