    Designs an asymmetric Hann window pair based on the given parameters.

    This function retrieves a window function based on the `window` type, applies
    an adaptation based on `scheme`, and returns the corresponding `Window` object.

    Args:
        scheme (str): The adaptation scheme to use. Supported values:
            [
             `ola`,
             `wola`,
            ]
        analysis_segment_size (int): The size of the segment / analysis_window.
        hop_size (int): The hop size used for segmentation.
        synthesis_segment_size (int): The non-zero size of the systhesis_window.

    Returns:
        Window: A `Window` object containing the selected window function and its
            corresponding hop size.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unknown window type or scheme is provided.
