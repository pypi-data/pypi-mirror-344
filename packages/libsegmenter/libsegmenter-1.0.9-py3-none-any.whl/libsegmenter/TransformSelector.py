    Factory function to create a transform instance based on the specified backend.

    Args:
        transform (str): The transform to use. Supported options:
            ["bpd", "magnitude_phase", "spectrogram"].
        backend (str, optional): The backend to use. Supported options:
            ["numpy", "torch", "tensorflow"]. Defaults to "numpy".
        *args (Any): Additional positional arguments to pass to the segmenter.
        **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the segmenter.

    Returns:
        An instance of the transform corresponding to the chosen backend.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported backend is specified.
        NotImplementedError: If the backend is not implemented.
