    This function compresses weights in layers that have an enabled `weight_quantizer` with
    a supported quantization format. The compression is controlled by a pattern-based configuration.

    Args:
        quant_model: The quantized model to compress.
        compress_config: Dictionary mapping layer patterns to boolean compression flags.
            Defaults to {"default": True} which compresses all supported layers.

            Example configuration::

                {
                    "*.mlp.fc1*": False,  # Skip compression for fc1 layers
                    "default": True,  # Compress all other layers
                }

            Note: Each configuration except "default" is applied sequentially; therefore the later
            configurations will override the previous ones if the same layer is matched.

    Note: This function modifies the input model in-place.
