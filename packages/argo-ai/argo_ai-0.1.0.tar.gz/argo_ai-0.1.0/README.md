# ARGO

**ARGO** - *Agent-based Reasoning, Governance, and Orchestration* - is a Python framework for building powerful, collaborative multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and other AI components. Inspired by the legendary ship Argo that carried the Argonauts on their epic quest, ARGO unites diverse intelligent agents to reason, govern, and orchestrate complex workflows together.

In Greek mythology, the Argo was a ship built by the master craftsman Argus and guided by the goddess Athena. It carried a crew of heroes-the Argonauts-on a daring quest for the Golden Fleece. This legendary voyage symbolizes teamwork, leadership, and the power of collective effort to overcome challenging tasks.

Similarly, **ARGO** embodies a system where multiple specialized agents collaborate under structured governance and orchestration to solve complex problems that no single agent could tackle alone.

## Key Concepts

### Agent-based Reasoning
Each agent in ARGO is an autonomous entity capable of independent reasoning, perception, and action. Agents leverage large language models and AI tools to interpret data, make decisions, and contribute specialized expertise to the collective.

### Governance
ARGO incorporates a governance layer that structures agent interactions, defines roles and responsibilities, and enforces protocols to ensure alignment, compliance, and accountability within the multi-agent system.

### Orchestration
The orchestration component manages communication, task allocation, and workflow execution among agents. It supports flexible collaboration patterns, from linear pipelines to dynamic, adaptive workflows.

## Features

- **Multi-agent collaboration:** Build teams of LLM-powered agents working in concert.
- **Structured governance:** Define organizational models and enforce collaboration protocols.
- **Flexible orchestration:** Coordinate complex workflows with customizable communication and task delegation.
- **Extensible architecture:** Easily add new agent types, tools, and interaction patterns.
- **Pythonic API:** Intuitive interfaces designed for rapid prototyping and deployment.

## Installation

```bash
pip install argo
```

## Why ARGO?

By combining autonomous reasoning, structured governance, and dynamic orchestration, ARGO unlocks the full potential of multi-agent LLM systems. Inspired by the mythic voyage of the Argo, this framework enables scalable, robust, and efficient AI collaboration for complex real-world challenges.
