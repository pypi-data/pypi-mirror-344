# Units:
#  "lambda" is in Angstroms
#  "pass" is the contribution to the detector signal per photon
#         entering the atmosphere of Earth (for airmass 1.3)
# 
# Bandpass Name(s): flat5400n
# 
# Instrument: None
# 
# Date of determination: 2023-04-14
# 
# Notes:
# 
#  Just a flat response from 5200 A to 5600 A
