# DecTrig
# Still in R&D Phase
This is a new theoretical framework for angular measurement by replacing traditional degree-based units with a base-10 rational system. The goal is to simplify trigonometric computation, create consistency in scaling, and allow for easier calculations by hand or algorithmically, while maintaining functional alignment with current trigonometric values. The system redefines the quarter-circle (traditionally 90Â°) as 100 new "rational degrees," or DT units, enabling decimal-based scaling and proportional trigonometric outputs that are more accessible for both human intuition and mathematical precision.

Long-Term Vision and Goal:

Replace, or rather compliment, degrees/radians in early math education
Be implemented in calculators and computer systems for more efficient computation
Offer clean models for:
Satellite positioning
Optical angular systems
Graphical modeling
Robotics and navigation
Astronomical coordinate systems
