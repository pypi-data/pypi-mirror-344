# Introduction

A Python client library to use with a Blueback Investigator. This library allows investigation objects to be accessed via Python. The investigation can be defined directly in Petrel, in an invpy file or via a Pandas dataframe. The investigation object can be queried at various levels. The metadata that defines the investigation shape can be discovered. The raw sample data can be accessed as a dataframe for further analysis in the Python environment. Various plots (standard data science plots and geo-science specific plots) can be generated to QC the investigation data.
