## Features


## Installation

With a Python 3.10+ environment, you can install `gliomoda` directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gliomoda/):

```bash
pip install gliomoda
```


## Use Cases and Tutorials

A minimal example to create a segmentation could look like this:

```python
from gliomoda import Inferer

inferer = Inferer()

# Save NIfTI files
inferer.infer(
    t1c="path/to/t1c.nii.gz",
    t2f="path/to/t2f.nii.gz",
    t1n="path/to/t1n.nii.gz",
    t2w="path/to/t2w.nii.gz",
    segmentation_file="path/to/segmentation.nii.gz",
)

# Or directly use pre-loaded NumPy data. (Both works as well)
segmentation_np = inferer.infer(
    t1c=t1c_np,
    t2f=t2f_np,
    t1n=t1n_np,
    t2w=t2w_np,
)
```

## Trouble shoot

<details>
<summary>
Multiprocessing error
</summary>

If you get an error related to something like this:
<br>

```
RuntimeError: 
        An attempt has been made to start a new process before the
        current process has finished its bootstrapping phase.

        This probably means that you are not using fork to start your
        child processes and you have forgotten to use the proper idiom
        in the main module:

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                freeze_support()
                ...

        The "freeze_support()" line can be omitted if the program
        is not going to be frozen to produce an executable.

        To fix this issue, refer to the "Safe importing of main module"
        section in https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html
```

Please ensure you properly wrap your script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    inferer = Inferer()
    ...
```
