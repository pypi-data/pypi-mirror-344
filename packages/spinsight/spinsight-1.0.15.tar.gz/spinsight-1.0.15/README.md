SpinSight MRI simulator
===
SpinSight is an MRI simulator written in Python and created for educational puposes. It jointly visualizes the imaging parameters, the MRI pulse sequence, the k-space data matrix, and the MR image. These are updated in near real-time when the user changes parameters. The simulator is run as a web browser dashboard. The data is simulated from computational 2D phantoms in vector graphics format (SVG).

Running the Simulator
---
Install using pip: 
```
pip install spinsight
```
Then run as a command line tool
```
spinsight
```
This serves SpinSight on the local host, so that the simulator can be run by navigating to [localhost](http://localhost) in the web browser. The same command line tool can be used to deploy the simulator on a local network, or on a web server (run `spinsight -h` for help). Be aware that several minutes are required upon loading a phantom for the first time.
