"""Toolbox for ensemble learning on class-imbalanced dataset.

``imbalanced-ensemble`` is a set of python-based ensemble learning methods for 
dealing with class-imbalanced classification problems in machine learning.

Subpackages
-----------
ensemble
    Module which provides ensemble imbalanced learning methods.
sampler
    Module which provides samplers for resampling class-imbalanced data.
