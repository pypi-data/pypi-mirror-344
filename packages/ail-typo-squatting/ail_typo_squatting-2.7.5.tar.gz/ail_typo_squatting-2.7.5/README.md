# ail-typo-squatting

ail-typo-squatting is a Python library to generate list of potential typo squatting domains with domain name permutation engine to feed AIL and other systems. 

The tool can be used as a stand-alone tool or to feed other systems. 

If you don't want to use the Python library, [https://typosquatting-finder.circl.lu/](https://typosquatting-finder.circl.lu/) is an online service which uses this library.

# Usage example

1. Creation of variations for `ail-project.org` and `circl.lu`, using all algorithm.

```bash
dacru@dacru:~/git/ail-typo-squatting/bin$ python3 typo.py -dn ail-project.org circl.lu -a -o .
```

2. Creation of variations for a file who contains domain name, using character omission - subdomain - hyphenation.

```bash
dacru@dacru:~/git/ail-typo-squatting/bin$ python3 typo.py -fdn domain.txt -co -sub -hyp -o . -fo yara
```

3. Creation of variations for `ail-project.org` and `circl.lu`, using all algorithm and using dns resolution.

```bash
dacru@dacru:~/git/ail-typo-squatting/bin$ python3 typo.py -dn ail-project.org circl.lu -a -dnsr -o .
```

4. Creation of variations for `ail-project.org`  and give the algorithm that generate the variation (**only for text format**).

```bash
dacru@dacru:~/git/ail-typo-squatting/bin$ python3 typo.py -dn ail-project.org -a -o - -var
```

# Used as a library

## To run all algorithms

```python
from ail_typo_squatting import runAll
import math

resultList = list()
domainList = ["google.com"]
formatoutput = "yara"
pathOutput = "."
for domain in domainList:
    resultList = runAll(
        domain=domain, 
        limit=math.inf, 
        formatoutput=formatoutput, 
        pathOutput=pathOutput, 
        verbose=False, 
        givevariations=False,
        keeporiginal=False
    )

    print(resultList)
    resultList = list()
```

## To run specific algorithm

```python
from ail_typo_squatting import formatOutput, omission, subdomain, addDash
import math

resultList = list()
domainList = ["google.com"]
limit = math.inf
formatoutput = "yara"
pathOutput = "."
for domain in domainList:
    resultList = omission(domain=domain, resultList=resultList, verbose=False, limit=limit, givevariations=False,  keeporiginal=False)

    resultList = subdomain(domain=domain, resultList=resultList, verbose=False, limit=limit, givevariations=False,  keeporiginal=False)

    resultList = addDash(domain=domain, resultList=resultList, verbose=False, limit=limit, givevariations=False,  keeporiginal=False)

    print(resultList)
    formatOutput(format=formatoutput, resultList=resultList, domain=domain, pathOutput=pathOutput, givevariations=False)

    resultList = list()
```

# Sample output

There's **4 format** possible for the output file:

- text
- yara
- regex
- sigma

For **Text** file, each line is a variation.

```
ail-project.org
il-project.org
al-project.org
ai-project.org
ailproject.org
ail-roject.org
ail-poject.org
ail-prject.org
ail-proect.org
ail-projct.org
ail-projet.org
ail-projec.org
aail-project.org
aiil-project.org
...
```

For **Yara** file, each rule is a variation.

```
rule ail-project_org {
    meta:
        domain = "ail-project.org"
    strings: 
        $s0 = "ail-project.org"
        $s1 = "il-project.org"
        $s2 = "al-project.org"
        $s3 = "ai-project.org"
        $s4 = "ailproject.org"
        $s5 = "ail-roject.org"
        $s6 = "ail-poject.org"
        $s7 = "ail-prject.org"
        $s8 = "ail-proect.org"
        $s9 = "ail-projct.org"
        $s10 = "ail-projet.org"
        $s11 = "ail-projec.org"
    condition:
         any of ($s*)
}
```

For **Regex** file, each variations is transform into regex and concatenate with other to do only one big regex.

```
ail\-project\.org|il\-project\.org|al\-project\.org|ai\-project\.org|ailproject\.org|ail\-roject\.org|ail\-poject\.org|ail\-prject\.org|ail\-proect\.org|ail\-projct\.org|ail\-projet\.org|ail\-projec\.org
```

For **Sigma** file, each variations are list under `variations` key.

```
title: ail-project.org
variations:
- ail-project.org
- il-project.org
- al-project.org
- ai-project.org
- ailproject.org
- ail-roject.org
- ail-poject.org
- ail-prject.org
- ail-proect.org
- ail-projct.org
- ail-projet.org
- ail-projec.org
```

## DNS output

In case DNS resolve is selected, an additional file will be created in JSON format

each keys are variations and may have a field "ip" if the domain name have been resolved. The filed "NotExist" will be there each time with a Boolean value to determine if the domain is existing or not.

```json
{
    "circl.lu": {
        "NotExist": false,
        "ip": [
            "185.194.93.14"
        ]
    },
    "ircl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "crcl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "cicl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "cirl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "circ.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "ccircl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    "ciircl.lu": {
        "NotExist": true
    },
    ...
}
```

| Subdomain          | These typos are created by placing a dot in the domain name in order to create subdomain. Example: google.com becomes goo.gle.com                                                                                                         |
| VowelSwap          | These typos are created by swapping vowels within the domain name except for the first letter. For example, www.google.com becomes www.gaagle.com.                                                                                        |
| WrongTld           | These typos are created by changing the original top level domain to another. For example, www.trademe.co.nz becomes www.trademe.co.mz and www.google.com becomes www.google.org Uses the 19 most common top level domains.               |
| WrongSld           | These typos are created by changing the original second level domain to another. For example, www.trademe.co.uk becomes www.trademe.ac.uk and www.google.com will still be www.google.com .                                               |
