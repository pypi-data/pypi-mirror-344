Fix bug of reading In filter from CDF to NEAT (#1100)

# Description

`IN` filter was read as `NodeType` by default from CDF, and reading did
shallow check of the actual filter content. As result, `IN` filters,
which for example performed checks if a view property value is in the
range of values, was mistakenly read as `NodeType` instead of
`RawFilter`. This led to errors in importing data model from CDF.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Fixed

- Fixed bug with reading RawFilters from CDF, especially `IN` filters
which are not `NodeType` filters
