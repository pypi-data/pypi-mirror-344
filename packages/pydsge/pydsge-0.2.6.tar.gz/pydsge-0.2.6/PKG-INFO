----

A package for solving, filtering and estimating **linear** DSGE models with the ZLB (or other occasionally binding constraints).

The set of methods is introduced in the paper `Estimation of DSGE Models with the Effective Lower Bound <https://gregorboehl.com/live/bczlb_BS.pdf>`_ *(Gregor Boehl & Felix Strobel, 2023, JEDC)*, where we also estimate the medium-scale New Keynesian model to post-2008 US data.

Check out my `Econpizza <https://github.com/gboehl/econpizza>`_ package if you are interested in simulating **nonlinear** DSGE models with (or without) **heterogeneous agents**.

A collection of models that can be (and were) used with this package can be found in `another repo <https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/yamls>`_.

Installation
-------------

Installing the stable version is as simple as typing

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pydsge

in your terminal (Linux/MacOS) or Anaconda Prompt (Win). 

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found on `ReadTheDocs <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_:

- `Installation Guide <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_guide.html>`_
- `Getting Started <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_
- `Module Documentation <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html>`_

Citation
--------

**pydsge** is developed by Gregor Boehl to simulate, filter, and estimate DSGE models with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates in various applications (see `my website <https://gregorboehl.com>`_ for research papers using the package). Please cite it with

We appreciate citations for **pydsge** because it helps us to find out how people have
been using the package and it motivates further work.


Parser
------

The parser originally was a fork of Ed Herbst's fork from Pablo Winant's (excellent) package **dolo**. 

See https://github.com/EconForge/dolo and https://github.com/eph.
