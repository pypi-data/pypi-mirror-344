# GhostCord

GhostCord is a lightweight, async Python library for controlling Discord user accounts (selfbot behavior). It is designed to be modular, secure, and extensible, with zero external dependencies except `httpx` and `websockets`.

## Features
- Fully async with Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Send, edit, delete messages, and add reactions
- Read incoming DMs
- Rich Presence support (custom activities, images, timers, buttons)
- Smart rate limit handling
- Secure token handling (never logged or printed)
- Event system (`on_ready`, `on_message`, etc.)
- Prefixed command handler (e.g., `.ping`, `.say`)
- Automatic WebSocket reconnection
- Clean logging system (info/debug/error levels)

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install httpx websockets
   ```

2. Clone or download the GhostCord repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xAI/GhostCord.git
   cd GhostCord
   ```

3. Install the library:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Example
Create a file `bot.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from ghostcord import Client

client = Client(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", prefix=".", log_level=20)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {client.user}")

@client.command()
async def ping(message, args):
    await client.send_message(message.channel_id, "Pong!")

async def main():
    try:
        await client.connect()
    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

### Rich Presence Example
Set a custom Rich Presence:

```python
import asyncio
from ghostcord import Client
import time

client = Client(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", prefix=".", log_level=20)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {client.user}")
    await client.presence.set_rich_presence(
        name="GhostCord",
        type=0,
        details="Running a selfbot",
        state="Developed by xAI",
        start_timestamp=int(time.time()),
        large_image="ghostcord_icon",
        large_text="GhostCord Library",
        buttons=[{"label": "Visit xAI", "url": "https://x.ai"}],
    )

async def main():
    try:
        await client.connect()
    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
