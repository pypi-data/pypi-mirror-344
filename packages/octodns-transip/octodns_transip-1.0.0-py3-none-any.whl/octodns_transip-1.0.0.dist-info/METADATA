    # Your Transip account name (required)
    account: env/TRANSIP_ACCOUNT
    # Path to a private key file (required if key is not used)

### Support Information

#### Records

TransipProvider A, AAAA, ALIAS, CAA, CNAME, DS, MX, NAPTR, NS, SPF, SRV, SSHFP, TLSA, TXT

#### Root NS records

TransipProvider support root NS record management.   
**notes:** 
  - Transip currently only supports FQDN values for root nameservers.
  - Transip has no TTL for root nameservers, so the TTL value from the source is ignored 


#### Dynamic

TransipProvider does not support dynamic records.

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.
