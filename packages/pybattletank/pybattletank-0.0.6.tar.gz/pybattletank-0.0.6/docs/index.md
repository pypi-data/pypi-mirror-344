pybattletank is a simple tower defense game written using
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to explore
game development and the Python packaging landscape.

The gameplay is based on Philipe-Henri Gosselin's well-written series [Discover
Python and Patterns](https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/discover-python-and-patterns/).
